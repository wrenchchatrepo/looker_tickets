--   1.	Precision (0.8594): The precision is quite high, which means that when the model predicts a positive class (a certain CSAT category), 85.9% of those predictions are correct. This indicates that the model has a low rate of false positives.
-- 	2.	Recall (0.4240): The recall is relatively low at 42.4%, which suggests that the model is missing a significant portion of the positive cases (i.e., it’s not predicting the positive class as often as it should). This means there are more false negatives—cases where the actual class is positive, but the model failed to predict it.
-- 	3.	Accuracy (0.7765): An accuracy of 77.6% indicates that the model correctly classifies about three-quarters of all cases, which is decent overall but could be improved depending on the complexity of the problem and the distribution of your dataset.
-- 	4.	F1 Score (0.3974): The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is lower due to the imbalance between the high precision and the lower recall. This suggests that the model is favoring precision over recall, resulting in a relatively low F1 score. A balance between precision and recall might be needed depending on the business use case.
-- 	5.	Log Loss (1.6527): Log loss measures how uncertain the model is in its predictions. A log loss of 1.65 is quite high, indicating that the model is making uncertain predictions for some classes. Lower log loss is better, as it shows that the model is more confident in its predictions.
-- 	6.	ROC AUC (0.8337): The ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is 0.8337, which is good. This metric measures the model’s ability to distinguish between the classes. A value of 0.83 indicates that the model does a good job at ranking predictions, which means it has a strong ability to separate the positive and negative classes.

-- Recommendations:

-- 	1.	Improve Recall: Since the recall is lower, you might want to adjust the model to capture more of the positive cases. You could try adjusting the classification threshold or using a different model type or hyperparameter tuning to balance precision and recall.
-- 	2.	Hyperparameter Tuning: You could experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., max_iterations, learning_rate) to improve performance. Boosted trees typically benefit from fine-tuning.
-- 	3.	Rebalance the Dataset: If the classes in your dataset are imbalanced, consider using techniques like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to improve recall.
-- 	4.	Review Features: You could consider adding or refining features that could help improve the model’s performance. Feature engineering might reveal more predictive attributes.
