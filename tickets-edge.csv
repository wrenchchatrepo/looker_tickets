I've been interested in Looker's internal system activity data of late. I've noticed that it is super slow to query this - on occasion, queries timeout.



We've also tried exporting the data via an Airbyte sync (https://airbyte.com/connectors/looker), but those syncs also time out.



Do you have any details on our backend database for Looker? Is it yet hosted on a MySQL database or is it completely in-memory?

Are there any options for us to self-host it perhaps? (This Looker post on the topic springs to mind: https://help.looker.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420185625491-Migrating-the-Looker-backend-database-to-MySQL)

Are you sure that you specifically need access to the GCP project? The reason I ask is because there appears to be no specific GCP project-id relating to our Google-hosted Looker instance (I entered the 'web-events-documentation' project-id because this field is mandatory on the doit request - but it has nothing to do with Looker).



What I can actually do is generate an Admin Looker user for you; therefore you can access our Looker instance.



Would that be a solution for access here? Or am I wrong about the GCP access?



Best,



Lewis

My name is Dion Edge and I'm going to help you on these three issues:

_1. Do you have any details on our backend database for Looker? Is it yet hosted on a MySQL database or is it completely in-memory?_

    Looker uses MemSQL for it's internal application database.

_2. Are there any options for us to self-host it perhaps?_

    Unfortunately, self-hosting is not an option.

_3. I've noticed that it is super slow to query this - on occasion, queries timeout._

    Would you, please, copy and paste the URLs to the admin pages that are timing out? For example:

    https://foo.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/system__activity::content_activity

    If/after the page times out, please go to the looker log:

    https://foo.cloud.looker.com/admin/log

    and filter by the page name. In this example you would filter by: **content_activity**

    Please, copy and return the filtered log output. That should give us some meaningful information.

Thank you.

Thanks for your response!



I have today opened the below System Activity dashboards and have recorded logs as best as I can when queries timedout (see attached).



1) https://smallpdf.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/system__activity::content_activity & logs in file content_activity.json file

2) https://smallpdf.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/system__activity::instance_performance & logs in file instance_performance_logs.json

3) An additional file of logs under the search phrase ""timeout"" in file timeout_logs.json



I hope this helps!

Apologies for the delay in response, I’ve been out-of-action now that I am on paternity leave. I am able to make a comment now in response though.



Thanks for clarifying that the system activity of our Looker instance is MemSQL.

I do not really notice a change in speed of queries to the system activity explores. It’s not been possible to successfully sync Looker’s Query History with Airbyte. It just continues trying to sync for multiple days.



Would it be possible to migrate backend from MemSQL to MySQL? Is this possible for Google-hosted customers, such as Smallpdf?



Thanks,



Lewis

Sorry for the late reply on this matter.



I would like to re-escalate this since we are still seeing these issues. Looks on the internal dashboards ""User Activity"" and ""Content Activity"" are still slow and returning ""Looker is having trouble connecting to your database. Connection timeout."" when you try to refresh the dashboards. Please continue investigation and reach out if you need more data from our side.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Philipp and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you need assistance with the configuration of your Looker BQ Block.
Are you planning to customize the Block, or what is the reason you want to include the Block files in your own Git?
Can you share screenshots of your current configuration and explain where you got stuck?

That being said, I see that you're located in the US, while I'm writing you from the Germany.
However, I blocked a few later meeting-slots for you over here: https://calendly.com/d/g2s-vzh-jjq/install-bigquery-resource-monitor-looker-block-90123
Feel free to schedule a meeting, and we can jump on a call early next week. If you don't find any suitable time, please let me know your preferences.

Looking forward to working with you on this.

Here is a summary of our hour and a half working session today. Please, pass this on as you see fit.

Problem: Some scheduled Looks, but not all, are being killed by the SFTP server with a Looker generated error (paraphrased) remote host killed connection due to timeout.

Database: PostgreSQL 9.6 (default timeout is 30s but if the db is killing the query, I think we would get a SQL error in Looker, which we are not. I think the SFTP server is killing the query but I could be wrong (if the SFTP timeout is NULL, default is also 30s).

**1ST Recommendation: We should increase both the SFTP and database timeout limits to AT LEAST 300s.**

Investigation: We see the same timeout errors in the looker instance admin/scheduled_jobs and confirmed:


1. Same error
2. Multiple users
3. Different frequencies
4. 40s timeouts

So, we picked one Look that was failing and observed:


1. No results returned
2. No database or LookML errors
3. No LookML errors in the model or view files
4. No unusual or complex LookML (weird syntax, extends, etc)

We opened the Explore of the Look:


1. Removed each of the fields, one at a time, reran the query, no results even for only field
2. Start over, removed the `-1`row limit (Looker hack to have no row limit in the Explore), no results
3. Start over, removed one of the two filters, RESULTS
4. Start over, removed the other filter, RESULTS

NOTE: Next time, start with the filters.

**So, now we know the problem is in the JOIN in the SQL generated by Looker IF the Look SHOULD generate results as defined.**

We identified the JOIN in the model file creating this behavior:


    explore: Returns_Model { from: return_process_info label: ""Returns Model (QA)"" description: ""Returns Order and Item Information"" #cancel_grouping_fields: [order_info.order_number,order_info_items.product_sku,order_info_items.id,Returns_Model.return_tracking_number,order_info.created_date,Returns_Model.created_date,Returns_Model.return_tracking_delivery_date,return_reason_codes.retailer_reason_code,return_reason_codes.display_name,Returns_Model.refund_option,return_process_items.user_comments] join: return_process_items { type: left_outer sql_on: ${return_process_items.return_process_info_id} = ${Returns_Model.id} ;; relationship: many_to_one }


This is where I think there might be a problem: this left_outer join with a many_to_one relationship. There are five more JOINs in the model file.

**My working theory is the relationships between these tables is not what is represented in the LookML model file.**

Again, since there is no LookML or SQL errors, these relationships in the model file could be defined correctly and these queries are legitimately returning no results. However, given the number of people experiencing the same problem we should have a plan to reach a resolution.

I asked Miray to put me in touch with the Looker Admin/Developer that created this model file because I am not familiar with the customers underlying schema. I did not want to randomly test JOIN type and relationship values, hoping to get lucky. Better to work with the customer who understands their data more than I ever will.

**2ND Recommendation: We should review the model file to verify JOINs match the underlying schema.**

Here's the plan if we need to execute 2ND option:


1. Work with Dina Care Looker developer to update model
2. Verify changes by running Look to generate expected results
3. Verify other failing Looks are using same or different model file
4. Run Looks to verify they will run successfully when scheduled
5. Identify technical debt if any

Business Context : Founded in Paris in 2016 with 10 locations worldwide, Scibids develops customizable AI to make marketing more effective. Scibids AI drives step-change performance and scale independently and was created with a privacy-first approach and has never relied on third-party cookies, PII, or other digital identifiers to drive growth and successful business outcomes. Scibids works across the digital marketing ecosystem and is enabled within the leading Demand Side Platforms, embraced by global media agencies, and trusted by international brands.

Looker Usage: The customer has a looker contrat. But they are a little bit disappointed with data vizualisation capabilities of looker. They said that Data Studio has better vizualisation capabilities than Looker. The goal of the session is to : 1) help them better understand the data vizualisation capabilities of Looker. 2) they showed interest in the Looker Studio Pro. https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/12671821?hl=en&ref_topic=6267740 The idea is to help them better understand the difference between the two products and help them choose the best product that answers their needs to anticipate the renewal in June 2023 of the Looker contract. This is the use case they described :

Measure the company performance and bring the data to the entire company. To do so, they need answer three questions: What metrics?Where to store them?Where to display them?

Google BDR got a request for a Looker Demo. The initial meeting will focus on qualification, lead by the Looker rep, but the customer did share some criteria. It would be helpful to the conversation to have an Engineer on hand as backup:

I have a short list of minimum requirements for a solution. While this list will likely grow as we finish collecting business and technical requirements from our internal stakeholders, I want to share it now in the hopes of saving both of us some time.

-

Externally hosted. Multi-tenant is fine, though we’ll likely need to engage our security team if that’s the case.

-

Embed capabilities. The reports can be embedded into our product so it looks like it’s part of the site.

-

A seamless login experience for the user. The login process can be integrated with our application’s login to provide single sign-on so the client doesn’t need to log into our site and then log into the reporting tool.

-

Row-level security so we can build a single report and have it automatically filter to different clients based on who is viewing it.

-

Highly customizable. At minimum, we can use custom color palettes and fonts. We want the reporting to look like a fully integrated part of our product.

-

Easy administration. The chosen solution needs to scale for basic needs (normal turnover in client contacts needing new access) and for anticipated growth (adding new seats).

So, this is the solution I am building for our BQ/Looker instance:

https://blog.searce.com/looker-user-level-cost-and-usage-of-bigquery-3c21389ebdc1

It's not trivial but it joins Looker and BQ metadata and provides, I think, precisely what you want.
I'm going to implement this next week so you can wait until I report back whether or not it works
or you can try it yourself.

Please, let me know what you think.
Thanks!

Nexstar is looking into Looker Studio Pro and had initially asked about cost around Pro and private labeling Looker.

We determined we wanted to understanding more of the intent and use cases involved, as we would be exploring Looker as a potential option for them.

We would benefit having a back up technical resource to help answer any questions, especially around BI as a whole.

This will work but there are some caveats worth noting:

+ There is a concurrency limit of 1 on the activity tables (excessive activity can lead to table locks)
+ Avoid the `information_schema` and use the billing export for Bigquery instead
+ `history_id` has been renamed to `history_slug`

Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks!

I think you need to set Database Time Zone and Query Time Zone on connection parameters. Those are needed for any date conversions like in your WHERE clause. Please see the following:


## Database Time Zone
The time zone in which your database stores time-based information. Looker needs to know this so that it can convert time values for users, making it easier to understand and use time-based data. See the Using time zone settings documentation page for more information.


## Query Time Zone
The **Query Time Zone** option is visible only if you have disabled **User Specific Time Zones**.
When **User Specific Time Zones** are disabled, the **Query Time Zone** is the time zone that displays to your users when they query time-based data, and the time zone into which Looker will convert time-based data from the **Database Time Zone**.
See the Using time zone settings documentation page for more information.

Please, let me know how this goes.
Thank you.

Please, test the connection again. It will probably be all green but it's a good idea to test.
Please, run the query again and screen capture the generate SQL and the error.
The errors may point to the JDBC driver. I'm researching aurora GitHub repo for known issues.

Thanks!

based on the documentation to sending/scheduling formats I see 3 formats are supported:



The **Format** field contains a drop-down menu of available formats:

- **CSV zip file**: The unformatted data from the dashboard delivered as a collection of comma-separated values (CSV) files in a zipped directory. For deliveries to email, the ZIP file is delivered as an email attachment.
- **PDF**: An image of the dashboard as a single PDF file. The default layout displays tiles as they are arranged in the dashboard, but other layout and sizing options are available under **Advanced options**. For deliveries to email, the file is delivered as an email attachment.
- **PNG visualization**: An image of the dashboard as a single PNG file. The default layout displays tiles as they are arranged in the dashboard, but other layout options are available under **Advanced options**. For deliveries to email, the image appears inline within the body of the email.



As we have a customer asking us to receive the schedules in json and/or xml can you please let me know the options to this? Thsi would be relevant for schedule name ""HELVETIC Flight_Supplier_Statistics (Basic)"".



Thank you for checking this.

Thank you for the provided guidelines!



I would just like to have a clarification. Is there any specific reason why we should avoid using information_schema for getting details about queried amounts?



For example, couldn't we potentially just use the following query as a basis for a derived table and merge it with ""User"" system explore in Looker on User ID field if we just wanted to see amount of queried bytes per user?

    select REGEXP_EXTRACT(REGEXP_EXTRACT(query, r'""user_id"":[0-9]+'), r'[0-9]+') as looker_user_id, *
    from `region-eu.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`

Technically it seems like it should work.





Thanks for your help with this!

As mentioned in my previous ticket, #91032 ,we would like to have a hands-on assistance session regarding the following issue:



1. How do we create relative time filter? A filter that allows the user to dynamically choose relative time frames - last week, last month, previous day etc..

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Renato and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you want to know how to create relative time filter that allows the user to dynamically choose relative time frames.

I was looking at the ticket you mentioned and Philipp recommended you to take a look at this training [1] which shows exactly how to create the filter you want.

Have you taken this training? If yes, were there any blockers?

We have time filters already setup in our queries. What we need is to add a time filter to a specific dashboard that has many merged queries/explores in it with diff timeframes included. For example one of the queries needs to be filtered by ""create date"" another by ""close date"" another by ""snapshot date"" and they are all in 1 merged query. And in the dashboard I can only pick 1 option (either close date, create date, or snapshot date) so it doesn't help me. I know in salesforce and tableau for example you can pick multiple dates in 1 filter. So you can type ""this month"" and you can say which field to take so if it's a closed won report you take the close date field and if it's a creation report you take the create date field. Does that make sense? Let me know if you want to get on a call to discuss :)",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,27.1,651.6,0,1.1,67.4,"$206,589",1,1

Are you available this week for a brief video call so that I can collect some information about your Looker environment. Sharing data in the way you described is completely feasible in Looker but there are different capabilities depending on your configuration.

After consulting with out MySQL experts here at DoiT, this could be a version issue in MySQL itself (about 30 points behind current). Would you be able to provide us the Aurora cloudwatch error log? That should confirm the precise issue.

This is specific method your user will need to run to download a csv from a specific Look:

https://developers.looker.com/api/explorer/4.0/methods/Query/run_query?sdk=py

To do this, you must grant them the required permissions to download data:

This  looks like a permissions issue between Salesforce and Looker. Please try the following:

Log in to the Google Admin console.
Navigate to Security → API controls → App access control.
Find Salesforce with the Client ID matching the one mentioned on the error page.
Set the access level to Trusted.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Lucas and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you would like to have a custom color on the tile background.

To achieve this you need to change [1] [2] parameters with something like this:

Could you please send me what you have already tried?  I will be happy to help you.

Thank you for your support on my previous request. I have another doubts too:



- I have created a custom field for my visualization: ""DPD Bucket"" and I have applied a filter on it to not include ""8. 180+"", but the said bucket is still visible in my output table. Attached screenshot for your reference.
 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ajKZ8o9iUNmvbdGDDl5K0BAMU/?name=xofadqtf.png)
- I have another custom field: ""# Unique Emails"" which pulls in 2 fields from 2 different views: ${derived_email_information.sent_date}), ${collection_assignment_master_case.lai}. I have added a join for these tables in my model too. But still the following error message pops up: _Measure ""count_of_unique_emails"" depends on fields from multiple views which is not supported for custom measures. __project_test_dimcontract/models/project_test_dimcontract.model.lkml:12_



 Kindly provide an alternative solution to this issue. How can I use two fields from different views/tables if not via custom fields?

1. adding me here https://<your-looker-instance>.cloud.looker.com/admin/next/users/add with the ""View"" role should be sufficient I believe
2. I just mean that you could define your combined field in your view definition in LookML, instead of as a Custom Measure. E.g see below for a self-contained example. I don't know what your actual logic is, so I am showing a contrived example:


    connection: ""arianplaygroundbq""explore: derived_email_information { join: collection_assignment_master_case { sql_on: ${derived_email_information.sent_date} = ${collection_assignment_master_case.date} ;; }}view: derived_email_information { derived_table: { sql: SELECT ""2022-01-01"" AS sent_date, ""hello"" as a UNION ALL SELECT ""2022-01-02"", ""howdy"";; } dimension: sent_date { type: date sql: ${TABLE}.sent_date ;; } dimension: a { type: string sql: ${TABLE}.a ;; } measure: count_hello_world { type: number sql: COUNTIF(${a} || "", "" || ${collection_assignment_master_case.b} = ""hello, world"");; }}view: collection_assignment_master_case { derived_table: { sql: SELECT ""world"" AS b, ""2022-01-01"" as date UNION ALL SELECT ""peeps"", ""2022-01-01"" UNION ALL SELECT ""everybody"", ""2022-01-02"";; } dimension: b { type: string sql: ${TABLE}.b ;; } dimension: date { type: date sql: ${TABLE}.date ;; }}

My apologies for delay in response and thank you for the code you shared. I have given the access to our system to you now, so you can please check it. I have a few more questions, along with previous ones:



1. With reference to the example you shared, I'm still unable to access any measure/dimension created in one view from the other one, despite of an existing join. The error was something like ""The said table doesn't exist"". Along with that, I'd like to see a filter over a count measure like the one you created.
2. The filter is still not working for DPD bucket in Collections Email Report. Link: https://lendingpoint.cloud.looker.com/looks/4
3.  What is Maximum Duration of Cache? What is Maximum Data Volume for cache report that we can create?
4. How can I create a report on very large datasets? Does looker store that data or pulls it from BQ every time? Do we have something akin to incremental loads/datasets/views?



Thank you again, for helping me with all my queries.

I have a couple of questions regarding the use of Looker as a data source in Looker Studio using Looker Google Connector:



- Is there a way to see if an explore is being used from Looker Studio or Looker? After checking system explores in Looker, I could not find a clear way to determine whether an explore is being used from Looker Studio.



- When building a Looker Studio dashboard based on a Looker explore, is there a way to change the way how fields are presented in the field picker? Currently a field name is a combination of Explore name and the actual field name (e.g. “Content Consumption Author Name” instead of just “Author Name” as it is in Looker) as it can be seen in the attached screenshot?



Thank you for clarifications!

Thank you for reaching out to us at DoiT International. My name is Steeve, and I am happy to assist you with your missing data in your Looker dashboard.



After conducting some research, it appears that your Looker dashboard may have been built using the COVID-19 Data Block Directory. However, it is important to note, based on the disclaimer at top of the page, that this directory does not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of its data or services.



Therefore, I'll reach out to the Looker support team on your behalf in order to shed some light into why since 9/17/2022 COVID-19 data stopped flowing to your dashboard.



I'll provide you with an update once I hear more from the team.

Thank you for your message.

If you believe your dashboard has not received new data since 9/17/22. Could you please re-install the COVID-19 Data Block Directory following the instructions on this link [1]?

I'm unfortunately unable access your Looker instance to view your dashboard due to customer data security policies.

Thank you for joining our call. Here is a summary of our video chat:

We discovered that the SQL statement running behind your derived table was causing the dashboard not being updated. Thus, we had to create a day filter, grab the SQL statement running behind it, so that we can adjust the faulty SQL statement on the derived table to obtain the correct data.

Kindly let us know if it is working after tweaking it or experiencing more issues

Best,

An update to the API situation and their use case. The customer has expressed they would like API access to our specific data query that we have a Look for. A CSV format should be sufficient and the data is updated every month. Is this something we could create?



We also have a few other customers who will want something similar for their data we hold.

I created this waterfall report, but not using the one in Looker.

Instead, I followed this topic in the Looker community. The reason we decided to use the described approach in the article is because the waterfall in Looker has a column _Total_ which is a bit confusing, and also the same column doesn't give us the possibility to drill down to understand what this _Total_ contains.



Since the chosen method gives us the outcome we are looking for, I have the following question which I hope you can help me find their answers.



1. Is it possible to have the _offset_ values hidden/transparent?
 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/X7ox1CsfDJceAYSUIie183lfH/?name=lgajorkd.png)


2. Is it possible to disable this offset column? Meaning, this offset column to still be present in the graph (visible), but not showing up while hovering with the mouse? In the article someone stated it in a comment, but I can't find the original topic to see how it is disabled.
 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/AfeGEmFxZyRkqCf2XW4ra8S4i/?name=xxiilfpi.png)




3.Is it possible to omit/exclude the _Total_ column from the Looker waterfall?

My name is Asad Khan and I will be assisting you on this ticket.   I understand you are looking to disable some content from a visual to appear in both Visual that you utilized from a Community Topic and also wondering if in the built-in Waterfall visual if the Total can be removed.


Can you share the link to where you got the Waterfall as the link you provided is not rendering.


Once i get the link, I will need to test the visual you utilized.

I am looking to add a window function to this query, that sums up the cumulative total for the date range filtered within the where clause in full.

This will allow me to add a third column (or calculation) that shows the customer's portion of the entire total for the date range.

Here is the link to the looker community waterfall topic I followed:Waterfall Charts | Looker Community

The look I created following the community article:https://planday.cloud.looker.com/looks/62

If possible, we would like to hide the offset values and to disable them when hovering over with the mouse.



The look using the waterfall chart in Looker:https://planday.cloud.looker.com/looks/61

This is look contains Total column which is confusing for us and also, we can’t drill down on it so we don’t know what is included in this Total.

I finally received this last night:


    I'm catching up here with the issues. I don't see too much helpful info with the attached evidence. Could you let me know if customer is willing to add me in the support access allowlist? I'll need to execute several tests on their instance and check information. My email is jcort@google.com and they should select ""Technical Support"" as reason. If this is not a possibility I'll need the customer to execute several tests.


So more tests are needed and jcort@google is requesting access from your end.

Contact your Looker administrator to re-assign this scheduled report to an enabled user."" So it will be good for Narvar to check those users and enable them or not, depending on their needs. Now, regarding the SFTP, I do see more success SFTP jobs than failed, I know this is not a sustained issue but the second common issue I see is this ""Authentication to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user 'SEVERAL USERS'"" this is an issue with credentials that Narvar needs to solve on their end if it's the case or it may be that users are not properly entering the credentials for your SFTP. Then, I do see some errors with: ""Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp-prod.shopwithgolf.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout""""Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed due to error: NoMethodError. message: undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass""I'll investigate those ones and let you know my findings ASAP. But please, could you let me know how many times they do see failed sftp deliveries and when they see them do they go to https://narvar.looker.com/admin/scheduled_jobs page and check the reason of why it failed? 


So this is progress! I apologize for how long this has taken but I think we have the attention this matter requires now.
Thanks!

    Could you tell me if when their SFTP fails only with the ""Upload to SFTP host sftp://ftp.verabradley.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout"" error, this is a constant error always for the same Looke/Explore/Dashboard with this same error?

I've tried clearing the browser cache, turning on legacy runtime, enabling automatic refresh...

Attached is a HAR file which captures my clicking ""clear cache & refresh"" and resizing the window a few times.



My current suspicion is that there is some sort of timeout issue. Your help would be much appreciated!",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,48.7,1168.2,1,36.4,2183.4,"$100,361",1,1

I was testing and also conferred with my colleagues, unfortunately the built-in waterfall visual does not have too much customization to remove the Total.   I was able to get it to the point that the Total bar does not come by using the white color for the Total, plus removing Gridlines and changing the label value to white.   This will not stop the ""Total"" text to show up on the x-axis, unless you turn off the x-axis labelling.  For the tooltip, there is no direct option to remove that as well, but you can use a workaround [1] to handle that.


Now, with the work around you did to create the Waterfall effect based on the Community code you found, again unfortunately since this is a nothing but a Bar chart.   I was only able to add the transparent by setting the Series color in ""custom"" to ""Transparent.  But this does not stop the tool tip to come up.  You may want to implement the workaround [1].

 has added a comment to your Google Cloud Support Case 30273882 - Schedule reports from Looker instance failing:

--- 

The customer previously stated:
`This issue happens randomly and I already shared the SFTP logs for earlier cases before. We have looked at SFTP logs and tried few things but cannot replicate the issue. That is why we have been trying over a month to get more detailed logs on the Looker side to see if we can determine if they have any reason code they get back when connection is closed.`
To be more precise:
1. The issue is not sustained, but random.Testing the Schedule does not return the `connection closed` error every time.
2. The outgoing server/port are connected to successfully with other scheduled reports.

I will see if the SFTP user can connect to the server/port destination using something like Filezilla.

This is most likely due to a proxy server (or load balancer) blocking exports. Would you, please, share the full error and log output from the Looker admin/log console?

Thanks for reaching out and setting this up.



I have been reading through the docs and tried to identify the project. It seems that I do not have sufficient rights and am not Project Viewer or Project Owner. At least none of the costs are shown that we receive via invoice directly from Google.


Am I missing something?

Hello,

Hi Dion,

Hope you are doing well!

I'm touching base here to see if customer was able to use filezilla or so to check availability to connect. Another ask I have is if customer knows the key-exchange used in their SFTP is it Diffie-Hellman?

Regards,
José

Just a couple of questions:

1. How many on Looks are on this dashboard?
2. Could you provide the Look ID of one or more that's generating this issue. If they are consistently throwing an error (sometimes they work, sometimes not) then it is most likely a timeout issue (as you intimated).

Thank you.

Thank you very much for our videocall today.



I send you the detail of the format bug that is converting a dot into a comma in the Explores (Picture 1) and Dashboards, but we can see that in the SQL Runner (Picture 2) it does appear correctly and the dimension (Picture 3) is defined as a string in the LookML.

Thanks for your feedback!



We have a bit a hiccup with the data so the model right now is not working.

Once we fix this issue, I will try to implement the last tip about disabling the toolpit on specific metric and see if this will be enough.

Hello,

Google Cloud Support has added a comment to your Support Case 30273882 - Schedule reports from Looker instance failing:



Hi Dion,

I hope you are doing well, and happy holidays!

Thank you for the heads up! I'm assigning this ticket as waiting on customer response and that's why our automation tool comes up and closes this one after 6 days with no response, but you can cancel it by sending a message to us and I'll provide another 6 window day. I'll standby after new years to see if we have a new update from customer.

Happy new year!

Regards,
José

I have a question regarding one particular visualization.

I need to show several metrics across 3 timeframes:

- current week
- last week
- current week prior year

I created custom dimension to have these 3 timeframes. By default when I select this dimension and the metrics, I get columns for each metric. However, I need to have metrics as rows and timeframes as columns. I managed to do this with transposing the data in the visualization (please see the screenshot).



Now I got a request to include additional columns to the visualization to show the following changes:

- current week vs last week
- current week vs current week prior year

So far, I haven't found a solution to add these columns to the transposed data. Do you know if it's possible to do it?

1. how are developer / admin licenses spread across the 2 x instances for feefoIBI and feefoPBL?
  1. Licenses are per instance so they will need to purchase additional licenses for additional users
  2. Licenses can be allocated to particular users if they assign specific IAM roles
  3. For Example, Looker `Platform Advanced (Powered by Looker) - Looker Hosted` is Looker Hosted includes one production Instance, 10 Standard User (Powered by Looker) - Looker Hosted End Users, 2 Developer User - Looker Hosted End Users, upgrades, up to 1,000 query-based API calls per month, along with 1,000 administrative API calls per month, and embedding. This should imply that the instance will have 2 Developer users that can be allocated. `LookerUserInternalAdmin` should imply 6 additional Admins can be added to a particular instance
2. is it even necessary to have admins on the PBL instance or is that purely for external viewers?
  1. Admins are necessary even for Power By Looker (PBL) instances. They control how external users will access the data. Security best practices found in [1]
3. Do developer / user licenses count towards `internalViewer`
  1. As per roles documentation [2], InternalViewer should count as a regular user/viewer. InternalAdmin would count towards developer.

Greatly appreciate your patience.

Based on the information provided, you had purchased the following platform licenses:


    LookerPlatformHostedAdvancedLookerPlatformPBLAdvanced


The above provide 1 production instance with 10 Standard User &  2 Developer User (Looker Hosted End Users) [1] each. Developer users are categorized as Admins [2] so you should be able to allocate at least 2 Admins to each instance.

Regarding the 6 additional Admin/Developer slots, those should be for a particular instance because, as per [3], licenses should be unique to a Looker instance. It is possible the users were split among the instances, however, I believe they were assigned to `LookerPlatformHostedAdvanced `due to the naming convention omitting `Powered By Looker` within the description. To confirm, we recommend contacting the Field Sales Representative that helped with this transaction. They should have more visibility on which instances these users were assigned and may be able to further assist in re-distributing the users, if needed.

Lastly, even for PBL instances, admins are necessary to help secure data access. Instance Admins are required to review security best practices noted in [4] but we also recommend Admins create permission [5] & model [6] sets as they would greatly assist in managing data access levels for multiple user groups. If needed, a detailed explanation on permissions management can be found in [7].

I hope this clarifies everything. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thanks for checking in!

The model now is working, and I was reading into the document you shared.



I think I will need a bit more help in this case.

Currently, I have created custom fields in the report/tile and by looking at the type=_Number_, does it mean that these are _dimensions?_

Offset:

Another way to look at it is if the Custom Field is an Aggregate than it will be a Measure where as non-aggregate will be a Dimension. [1]


In regards to the tooltip, can you share your code snippet for the measure that defines the tooltips.  If you can copy the code and send it versus a screenshot would be helpful.

We have followed the escalation protocol for DoiT to resolve this long-standing issue, to no avail.  cc @Nico Martinez for final escalation.  To date, campgladiator.cloud.looker.com is a working instance, and we are able to use the console to do primitive looker work.  We have many teams now blocked, however, because we still are unable to resolve a working API endpoint.  This is now a significant impact to our business, as nutrition reporting and revenue generation for trainers is impacted.  Meetings have been attended, requested, and postponed, but our original question remains unanswered.  Is this endpoint alive and working at a looker address?  The installation was not done by 66Degrees but by Looker/Google itself, yet the API endpoints currently resolve to AWS resolvers.  These resources need to be internal to GCP and included in our DoiT billable account.  Nico, please add anything you find relevant to the conversation.  Again, we are blocked with an escalated, long-unaddressed ticket that has significant business impact.

There are two steps your Looker admin will need to perform to complete the setup:


1. Connect to your database either by allowing specific IP addresses through your network layer or with an SSH tunnel. Instructions for both can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/looker-hosted-infrastructure-migration-information
2. Configure the Looker API. Instructions can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-platform-api

If you would like me to get on a co-dev with your Looker admin, please, let me know. I will make myself available today and tomorrow until I have to leave for the airport around 2PM EST.

When embedding a looker studio report in a web page using an iframe, a warning panel displays when I put my cursor over the community vizualisation. (please find attach the vizualisation)

This problem was not here before the 28th of december 2022.



What you expected to happen:

No warning panel when hovering the community vizualization or at least a configuration in looker studio to deactivate the warning.



Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a looker studio report

2. Create a spreadsheet, fill values in the first lines of the first sheet of the spreadhsheet to represent a data source

3. Connect the looker studio report to the spreadsheet as a data source

4. Add a community vizualization in the looker studio report (e.g. CSV filter or sunburst chart)

5. Enable embedded report

6. Copy embed iframe code for embed report

7. On your local PC, create a simple html file, paste the iframe code in the body of the html

8. Open a web navigator and connect to google with the same google account that the one you created the looker studio report with

9. Open your html file in the web navigator

10. When you hover your mouse on the community vizualization, the following message appear in a panel :

""You are about to interact with a community visualization in this embedded report. Do not enter your password or other sensitive information in this area. Be careful interacting with third-party content.""



Other information (documentation consulted, etc):

We have tried using the sandbox option with the iframe and disabling popups.

We have consulted forums, the CSV filter community vizualization documentation, looker studio developer documentation.

We created an issu on IssueTracker-Google : https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/264788280

Your naming conventions will be the key way to identify what is a measure vs dimension.

But you will note that as you select a calculation to add to the Look, the placement of the calculation will be positioned correctly as a dimension and a measure.


As you see from the screenshot below, I have 2 table calculations: PayType, Pct of Total.  Once I add it to the Look I am building, you will see Pct of Total was positioned at the measure side and PayType was seen as a dimension, it was placed at the end of the dimension section.

Hello Dion,

Thanks for reply. Ismail Looker EMEA TSE here.

Could you please clarify the last question:

- Edgardo, the customer's production environment is not able to resolve to the API endpoint. Can you confirm that the API is available for their instance?

What API endpoint is the customer attempting to reach?

What's the Instance URL we are attempting from?

The HOST URL on the instance should also be checked if any recent changes to the domain were made.

Regards

Ismail

Hello,

Google Cloud Support has added a comment to your Support Case 30273882 - Schedule reports from Looker instance failing:



Hi Dion,

Thanks so much for your reply.

Yes I agree this is challenging to catch since it is random and on Looker logs we just see a generic ""Upload to SFTP host sftp://ftp.verabradley.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout"" message. So, in this case the only step we can execute needs to be executed by customer and it is a packet capture:

1. Packet capture of when the connection is established.
2. They can use a tool like wireshark https://www.wireshark.org/ for this
3. Client MUST do this on SFTP server side, not from Looker side, as we want to see the messages from the SFTP server.
4. Once they have the previous steps they can filter the results by Looker IP requests and their server responses, and as well by traffic type (tcp and ssh).

We are trying to see if there is some kind of a miscommunication between servers, and this is the only way we can see it. And we would need to do this at least 2 times, one when connection is working as expected and another one and the most important, when the communication is failing. But as this is a random behavior customer need to be trying this until we have one failing with communication. As well, if they can keep trying with filezilla to have an incorrect communication log would be helpful, but pretty much packet capture is our best approach.

Regards,
José

GS is recommending packet capture onthe SFTP server side. I think this the best shot given how random the behavior it. Here are the steps:


    1. Packet capture of when the connection is established.2. They can use a tool like wireshark https://www.wireshark.org/ for this3.

Apologies for the missed invitation for the call - due to the different timezones we work on, I was already finished working for the day and my notifications were snoozed.



I implemented your suggestion, but unfortunately the toolpit is still showing up

          case
            when ${category} != '9.open' and ${dim_adjusted_amount} > 0 then ${dim_adjusted_amount}
            else 0

Are you looking for the entire ToolTip box to not appear?  If that is the case that is not possible.  The only thing we can do is hide the values in the Tooltip.

Is offset also a measure?

If so how is offset calculated?

we can look to jump on a call tomorrow, please your time slot availabilities.

Can totally be available for a call this week.  The view is included in the model.  Here's an image that shows the include.  You can't see the filename below, but it would be picked up by the wildcard b/c it does exist underneath the /views/manufacturing/*.view definition.

It's worth noting that there is a disconnect (inconsistency) between the naming convention and the filename.  Does that cause a problem?

We currently have an empty environment, where I activated the feature but it is not being shown in gsheets (although the same e-mail adresses have been used). As the environment is pretty empty I assume that some settings are not setup as necessary or it might be because there is no database connection yet?



I would like to get a consulting to set up this feature and understand what the required steps are (ideally in a meeting where we do things together, as my calendar is full as hell and I don´t have time to read through documentation to figure out things on my own in case it is not an easy step-by-step guide with pictures).

I'm evaluating the implementation of SAML SSO login in Looker so that users can be managed by our G Workspace Admin and help offload this responsibility from our data team and to increase security of course.



The main concern is that by enabling SAML SSO, anyone who tries to login with a JOKR Account would be assigned a Looker license and hence we'd lose control of licenses.



Could you confirm if we can manage the Looker licenses via G Workspace with SAML SSO and prevent anyone from being assigned a license if not approved by our IT team?



Also... Does looker support a SAML SSO integration with two different G Workspaces? (We've got a separate G Workspace for JOKR and for Soudaki)



Thanks in advance for your help!

For some reason, the colors in our visualizations aren't consistent across servers. As you can see in the attached screenshots, the colors in the featured visualization are not the same across our staging, embedded, and Insights environments. I have confirmed that everything is using the same color collection (Wpromote 2020 Palette) so I'm not sure what's going on. We have chosen the colors specifically to ensure that the graph is legible for our users so having them go rogue is not a good experience.



According to Looker's documentation, ""...a theme’s color collection will not override customized colors assigned to a data series, nor will it override conditional formatting applied to a table visualization.""



Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated!

Details:

Been working with a customer on two items:  Utilizing Waterfall chart (issue is they don't like the last total bar).  They have their on funnel process and they would not like to see that total bar, unfortunately I could not find any settings to turn off but gave them work around to hide the Total bar by changing the color.

But this workaround does not prevent the Tooltip to show.

They started following a blog on how to custom build a waterfall using column chart and offsets.  Issue still is the tooltip.

I have explained to them that there is no setting to disable Tooltip, it has been presented as a feature request.

I did provide a code snippet to hide the rendered value of the measure, but that does not remove Field Name and the Dimension.",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,73.1,1754.1,0,0.3,19.1,"$3,475",1,1

Please see this documentation to limit SSO/SAML user authentication. Here are the salient points:


The **Advanced Role Management** section contains these options:



**Prevent Individual SAML Users from Receiving Direct Roles**: Turning this option on prevents Looker admins from assigning Looker roles directly to SAML users. SAML users will receive roles only through their group memberships. If SAML users are allowed membership in native (not mirrored) Looker groups, they can still inherit their roles both from mirrored SAML groups and from native Looker groups. Any SAML users who were previously assigned roles directly will have those roles removed when they next log in.



If this option is off, Looker admins can assign Looker roles directly to SAML users as if they were configured natively in Looker.



**Prevent Direct Membership in non-SAML Groups**: Turning this option on prevents Looker admins from adding SAML users directly to native Looker groups. If mirrored SAML groups are allowed to be members of native Looker groups, SAML users may retain membership in any parent Looker groups. Any SAML users who were previously assigned to native Looker groups will be removed from those groups when they next log in.



If this option is off, Looker admins can add SAML users directly to native Looker groups.



**Prevent Role Inheritance from non-SAML Groups**: Turning this option on prevents members of mirrored SAML groups from inheriting roles from native Looker groups. Any SAML users who previously inherited roles from a parent Looker group will lose those roles when they next log in.



If this option is off, mirrored SAML groups or SAML users who are added as members of a native Looker group will inherit the roles assigned to the parent Looker group.



**Auth Requires Role**: If this option is on, SAML users are required to have a role assigned. Any SAML users who do not have a role assigned will not be able to log in to Looker at all.



If this option is off, SAML users can authenticate to Looker even if they have no role assigned. A user with no assigned role will not be able to see any data or take any action in Looker, but they will be able to log in to Looker.



I don't think it's possible to use more than one G Workspace on a single Looker instance but I think you circumvent this by using Groups to segment your JOKR and Soudak users explicitly.



Please let me know your thoughts.


Thank you.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Jared, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you would like to integrate Looker Studio with your Looker Instance. I would be happy to assist you with this.

I just spoke with another colleague who is a Looker expert and requested the same access. Below is the email he got from Looker:

> The Looker Studio Looker connector is available for Looker instances on Looker 22.16 or later that are hosted by Looker in the Google Cloud. The connector is not available for customer-hosted Looker instances or Looker instances that are not hosted in the Google Cloud.


Can you check and verify the instance version is 22.16 or later? You can hostname.com/version to verify.

He also mentioned that this is still in preview [1] and there is batched whitelisting.

Once access is granted, a Looker user with at least `explore` permissions must connect the Looker instance as a data source in a Looker Studio report using the Looker connector.

Further, once the connector is enabled, Looker Studio users with `access_data` and `clear_cache_refresh` Looker permissions can view Looker data in a Looker Studio report.

Let me know if this answers your question. If not, I'd be happy to help assist you further.

Unfortunately I can't find how to do a stacked bar chart in Looker.

Using the code here as my basis[1].

Thought is to determine where you are at in the quarter and store that in a dimension. Then the next dimension will contain the sales target data.

You would then display these on a stacked bar chart.

Code:

    dimension_group: created_date { type: time timeframes: [#for our purposes we need doy, qoy, year raw, date, day_of_year, #1-366 integer quarter_of_year, #Q1-Q2-Q3-Q4 string for dayofquarterindex case statement year #integer, used to account for leap years in q1daycount] datatype: date sql: ${TABLE}.created_date ;; } dimension: q1daycount { #accounts for 91 days in Q1 during leap years type: number sql: CASE WHEN MOD(${created_date_year}, 4) = 0 THEN 91 ELSE 90 END;; } dimension: dayofquarterindex { #returns day of quarter index int 1-92 type: number sql: DATEDIFF('day',date_trunc('quarter',${created_raw}),${created_date}) + 1 ;; }

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Sayle, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you are trying to visualize days left in a quarter and your quarterly sales targets in the same report.

I was doing some tinkering to try and discover how to do this, which led me on a rabbit hole quest but I was able to make some progress on this.

I want to preface this with I think we should all hop on a call with our resident Looker expert, whom is unfortunately out sick today, later this week as I would love to hear his thoughts on this as well. If you could share your availability for later this week I can get something set up.

My thoughts on this are to create two dimensions that contain where you are in the current quarter timewise and another containing where you are in the quarter sales target-wise. Then plotting this in a ""multivariate"" chart such as a stacked bar chart, maybe a bar chart with a line on it, or maybe even a combination using both of these. I think this point is where we could definitely have a good discussion on a call to determine what would work best.

As for implementing this I was trying to get my head around how this would be done and found this forum post here[1] which I think does a phenomenal job of implementing this cleanly. Here is the code I was able to build from it[2] for doing the placement in quarter calculation using a created_date value from the data source. I also threw in a quarter calculator because it was bugging me seeing the start dates of the quarter in there. Note this is using the BQ SQL syntax in case you are using a different database.

Then for your sales target you would need to do a calculation of it for each day (I don't know what your data looks like so it probably wouldn't be useful to build some code for it that probably would just be thrown away) and it should be just displaying those two dimensions on the graph to make it work. That's the part I would love to discuss in the call.

If you could just share your availability and I will sync with some of our Looker SMEs so we put our heads together to find the best way to implement this.

Thank you for getting in touch with DoiT International. My name is Steeve and I'll be assisting you about the issue you're experiencing setting up your model to create dashboard from PostgresSQL and Redshift data.

I'd appreciate it if you can provide me with some clarifications about the questions below:


1. Can you please elaborate on what you mean by the new data connection (PostgresSQL) that you recently added has introduced some problems?
2. What kind of errors that you're currently experiencing?
3. Where is the PostgresSQL databases located? (i-e GCP or outside of GCP)
4. If the existing connection is working as expected, are you following the same process to create the PostgresSQL one?
5. Are you following any public references that you can share?
6. What is your current Looker version?
7. Are you using Looker Studio or Looker Pro?

I'll be kindly waiting for your reply.

So unfortunately the connection to a test database didn´t worked out, but we managed to connect to our own internal database. I also requested allowance to add this Looker instance to the google workspace admin, so that I could enable the Google Drive and Google Analytics Actions. But unfortunately it is still not working and I don´t have a clue why this is so :( Even when I refresh or close and open the gsheet it doesn´t work.

Thanks for the call today.

Were you able to connect with Sayle on this?



To recap, I'm looking to pull two separate fields into my report:

1) Day of quarter - so if I were to run the report today, I would expect to see a value of 26 since its the 26th day of the quarter.

2) # of days in quarter - First quarter, Q1: 1 January – 31 March (**90 days or 91 days in leap years**)



We tried a couple of different functions, such as the one below, which did not work.

dimension: days_into_quarter {  # Returns difference between start of quarter and created_date

  type: number

  sql: DATETIME_DIFF('day',date_trunc('quarter',${created_raw}),${created_date}) + 1 ;;

  }



Looking forward to hearing from you. I'm also available tomorrow 9-10AM PST or 11-12PM PST if you wanted to chat.

I have a question around how we at Storytel should go about a support ticket we have filed to the Looker support.



In mid november we found that date formatting in many of our core dashboards were all of a sudden formatted very oddly. More specific, the dates had changed from being formatted as ""2022-11-01"" to ""Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 2022"" without us making any changes to the code. While this might not seem like a major problem, many of our Looker users reached out and complained about this new format was very hard to read and make sense of the data in. We investigated the problem and found that this odd formatting happens in specific cases, namely when we are making use of a ""date granularity"" dimension that refers to a parameter to toggle between weekly, monthly, daily granularity (see print attached). In addition to using this dimension, it is only when we use a pivot in a visualisation when this appears.



These very specific circumstances together with the fact that it showed up over night makes us believe this is a bug introduced by Looker. We have reached out to the Looker support, which haven't been able to provide us any solution other than turning on the legacy feature ""Legacy Lookml Run time"". The ""Legacy Lookml Run time"" is a Legacy feature that will be removed in 2 months from now. Since we have been in contact with Looker about this for soon to be 2 months without any progression and the date for removing this legacy feature is slowly approaching, I am now reaching out to you to hear what we can do in this case (and future similar cases) where we get no support or answer from Looker.



I attach some screen shots to display the problem. I fully understand if you cannot support in the technical solution, but hoping to get some advice how to tackle our support questions.

Summary: Drill fields from a dashboard weren't working (""No Results""); no LookML or reference errors; upon opening one of the relevant Looks we got a SQL bad reference error for a table name; corrected the table name and resolved the problem. We also added the `drill_fill:` parameter to measures to allow visualizations in the drill result dataset.

I hope I was able to address your request thoroughly and in a timely manner, Marc. As the next step, I’ll go ahead and close your ticket for now. If you do not agree or need more assistance, simply reply to the ticket with your feedback and the ticket will be re-opened automatically for us all.

I understand that you're seeing numerous Looker Explores which you aren't familiar with, and you would like to remove those as they make it hard to traverse the Looker UI.

Hello Dion,

 Thanks for the support.

 From what I can see in this case we have to verify the format of the Top Kpi VALUE field, SQL is performing the instructions well but in the explore is where we can modify the format of the value of the fields.

 I Found this docs to our value format options , for LookML fields, and for the visualization edit options .

 Let me know if this has been useful for this case, please.

Trustradius is looking to set up a few trainings revolving around BI - They've mentioned wanting to set up a brainstorming session around best practices for Git processes, deployment processes, etc. - as well as a more Looker-centric training. As a first next step I think it makes sense to have a 30 minute meeting with them (focused on their BI / Git process request) to gather more context around what their looking for specifically and set up additional sessions as needed from there. Looking to meet sometime next week

This connector was going to allow @campgladiator.com users to get into Looker Studio and see data flowing from Looker having only the Looker Studio license from the GSuite.

I.e.:

1. Camp Gladiator Developer, can create a dashboard in Looker

2. Use the BI Connector to get the data in Looker Studio

3. Any @campgladiator.com user with access to Looker Studio can get in there and see the data coming from Looker



Error: As the attached files suggest, it requests to link the @campgladiator.com account from GSuite to a Looker account.

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 42878497 for has been updated.

Case Subject: Inconsistent format results between Explore and SQL Runner

Case Comment :

Hi Christian! The format is properly applied in SQL Runner but not in the Explore/Look, which is quite odd to me. You still have access to the instance so you can test and see this behavior. Please, advise. /dion

Please review your case and take any actions as requested. If you have any questions or require immediate assistance, please reply to this email to contact Google Cloud Support.

Here are the prerequisites to enable Looker Studio on your Looker instance:

**View and edit the data source configuration**

- You must be a Looker user with at least `explore` permissions to complete these steps

**View Looker data on a report**

- If you do not have a Looker account, the admin for the connected Looker instance must create one for you. You must have at least `access_data` and `clear_cache_refresh `permissions for the model on which the Explore is based to view data from Looker data sources.

**Before the connector can be used, the following prerequisites must be met:**


- The Looker connector must be enabled in Looker Studio.
- If your Looker instance has the **Enable Allowlist** toggle enabled, you will need to allowlist the IP addresses that are used by Looker Studio (contact Support for the full list).
- Your Looker instance's Explores must use a database dialects connection that is supported by Looker Studio.
- Once the connector is enabled, Looker Studio users with `access_data` and `clear_cache_refresh` Looker permissions can view Looker data in a Looker Studio report.

Please, let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you.

Ah, I see. Only the technical contact for your instance (found on the admin page) may request a new license key for your instance using the Looker Support form. Since you're hosting your instance I am not sure how much of the original setup process you might need to repeat but I think it should be minimal if anything at all. Please, let me know if this satisfies your request.

Thank you.

We currently use the ""Schedule delivery"" feature (https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/scheduling-and-sending-dashboards) on a lot of our dashboards to send messages into Slack. However, these messages get sent out regardless of any metric/threshold. Is there a way to add a threshold to scheduled delivery so a dashboard only gets sent into Slack contingent on some condition?



Alternatively, we have looked at using Looker Alerts (https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/alerts-overview). However, the content of these alerts seems to be very limited. In the case of Slack alerts, we can't embed a png of the visualization nor a CSV of the data, and we can't even link back to the dashboard.



In either case (Schedule delivery or Alerts) we'd like to be able to customize the content of the Slack message. In order to make the messages as actionable as possible, the content of the message would ideally be dynamic based on the dashboard results.



Is there any way to accomplish some/all of these requirements with Looker? Happy to discuss live if that's easier.



Best,

I understand that you have a Looker report that users run, and the current configuration - which requires that they select their company's name from a drop-down box before data populates the report - is causing them some confusion.

Does that accurately describes the issue?

I basically want the end user to choose the subgrouping for Time in a graph that tracks a measure (y-axis) vs time (x-axis). It should effectively let them Zoom In/Out.



The results I'm getting seem like it's just defaulting to the ELSE statement even through I'm selecting parameter values that should force it to lower grains (minute, minute5, minute10, etc).



NOTE: I've played with the type/data_type parameters in the dimension and dimension group fields b/c some of the settings weren't charting the x-axis correctly. I'm not confident I have those setup correctly and they might be confounding the problem.

The access has been granted to romeronunez@google.com for the next 18 hours.

Here is a link where he can find directly the issue:

**https://bauhaus.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/51?Department=&KPI=Visits&Month+Name=&Year=2022&Relative+Date=2022-12**

under the column **""DELTA"".**

If we take the same query that is generated and take it to the SQL Runner, you will be able to see that the

result doesn't show a comma.



In other topics, there seems to be an issue with the DoIT portal, so I had to respond by this means.

The logs are under review with our Security team. We noticed that the same issue happens on our stg environments which has different version of Looker as well. The issue is impacting the company and we need to solve the issue immediately if is possible. **We are requesting to raise the priority of our ticket.**



In the meantime, were you able to find any solution or bug reported from looker regarding to our issue? We found that Chromium released a new tag at Feb 13 and it has some renderer changes. We do not upgrade the packages but Looker automatically updates dependencies. We are assuming there can be a compatibility issue between Chromium and Looker.





We are on Chromium 110.0.5481.100 snap version

Are we going to get a solution anytime soon for this issue? The ticket has been open for almost 2 months now.



I'll be pending for your answer.

As discussedin our call this afternoon, the CG team is going to reset the connection to BQ to see if that resolves the ongoing latency. Given the low usage/amount of data, performance degradation at this level is unexpected as confirmed by the Google Looker team.

**Dion Edge** can you please open a parallel case with Google in the case this last effort doesn't resolve some underlying issue not visibile to the CG/DoiT team. Once there's a case #, I will provide it to the Google Looker folks to escalate on our behalf.

Cheers,
Amanda

`campgladiator-production.relational_data.vw_subscriptions_data.Purchase_Date_CST` is used a LOT for dates in these queries and especially around intervals in the past. I would HIGHLY recommend recreating that table and partitioning on that field by day or month. This will give you a massive speed up in your queries.

In the same vein in `campgladiator-production.relational_data.vw_subscriptions_data` has two fields which has values checked on it a lot. The fields `Product` and `Status` are queried by the Looker user a lot. If you put a cluster on these two columns that would immensely speed up the queries on that table.

So I got to take a deep dive this morning into your data and ran a few of my ""magic queries"" on it which look at your query executions. I have attached the data I pulled from your environment for the longest running queries, with the query here[1]. Recommend loading this up in Sheets really fast to see what's going on.

You will notice at the start there are a few from this morning that took a really long time to run for some reason. I will cover those here later in this message as I think these were outliers, but as more data comes in there could be an issue later as data grows. Otherwise you will notice that practically all of your Looker queries (ones with looker-cg-779 in the user field) are sub-second or close to it.

As for the performance issues here I am passing this back to Dion as he back in the office for opening up a ticket with the Looker team. This appears to be something in Looker itself that's causing performance issues as the queries are running fast and processing minimal data (<100 MB which is like the size of an ant to a human in BQ terms).

As for the potential issues going forward I just grabbed that first slow query in there as a good example (job ID `job_dWwXL8-n0ac_BzQ-F5sJ67r6a8nG`) since it references a view a lot of the others do as well and ran this query to pull it's execution plan[2]. It's not easy to see in there but there is a column called `timeline.elapsed_ms` which is the time it took for each step to run. If you look at it the longest step is a ""Join+"" step which makes sense as joins are VERY slow in BQ so I started digging deeper into where a JOIN is happening.

I noticed it's traced back down to the `vw_subscriptions_data` view which has this join condition in it[3]. If you notice in there it's pulled id, name, and email out multiple times from the `public_trainers` table. Doing this same condition multiple times is definitely causing it to run MUCH slower than it should by doing multiple joins. This is also causing a condition called shuffling inside of the query execution which means that it is having to push data between compute nodes inside of BigQuery's core which is very slow, if you are familiar with operating systems this is very close to the same concept as virtual memory which means computations on disk versus memory slowdowns.

What I would recommend doing is to ""pre-compute"" this view instead of using it as a view meaning to build a physical table that defined as `CREATE TABLE vw_subscriptions_data AS <view definition query here>` instead. If it needs to be updated relatively often then I would recommend doing a rebuild on this on a schedule. The reasoning being is that when you query a view it runs the definition of it in the background so it's doing all of those joins every time it executes, if you only do that once when you build the query you are just doing reads when querying not joins.

I know this is a lot here, but if you would like me to do a BQ best practices session feel free to open up a ticket with us and just drop my name saying you would like this and I would be glad to host a working session to go over this.

With all of that said I am passing this back on to Dion so he can do a deep dive into the Looker part or raising a ticket with Google as needed because this is appearing to be a Looker issue.

I escalated the case with Looker and saw a related bug my colleague brought to my attention and, based on the errors in your log, it may be restrictive firewall parameters. Please, try the following setting:

Please, let me know if this is effective. I am waiting on Google Support but they should respond quickly.

Thank you.

Hello Dion,

 I am Kenelly from Looker support team. Thanks for reaching us out. I could see on our side we have already an open case (number 43553670) where our colleague Simone is helping Phillip on the same error message RendererNoRenderFinishedEventReceivedError. From what I could understand it seems the same issue. I am contacting her to get some more context on the case.

 Cheers,

I missed you on the call but I want update you on both issues:


1. Please confirm you are connecting Looker Studio to your Looker instance and not paying for Looker Studio Pro; also that you are have enabled your instance is set to `Enable AllowList`. If that is the case Google Support is resistant to providing support so I have to find another way to discover the AllowList.
2. Google Support is working on the latency issue so I do not have a resolution for you yet but I am in contact with the Looker Engineer working on the case.

If you want to meet later today, please let me know.

Thank you.

We’re trying to find solutions for a limitation we’re finding with Looker. Specifically, now that we’ve turned on SSO in our Looker instance, we don’t have the ability to create new e-mail based accounts. We have a need for this functionality because we want to have a small handful of e-mail based service accounts for API operations but we have a limited number of seats in our SSO environment and we can’t create those service accounts through there.



We currently have one account that was created this way, devops+looker@dinacare.com, but this seems to be grandfathered in from when we first stood up the instance and didn’t have SSO enabled. We need multiple, distinct service accounts for compliance with healthcare standards.



We’d appreciate any solutions you can provide!

Do you have time to discuss this on a Google Meet? I want to make sure I understand your objectives. This should be feasible with SSO but a brief call would be helpful. Please book time that works for you:

We've been working with Doit this week to triage a recent issue we're experiencing with Looker and I believe Doit has opened a case with Google to further investigate. Nothing that we're aware of has changed in our environments, but rendering PDF and PNG files/reports through Looker no longer works in Prod and our Staging environment.

We've read through Looker documentation online regarding rendering errors, but nothing we've tried seems to resolve the issue. If you could help escalate this case within Google, we'd appreciate it.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Mfg team wantS to modify how we calculate Yields to be a Rolling Throughput Yield, where the pseudo-code for the calculation is:



LEAST(Line 2000 Yield %, Line 2008 Yield %)

x Line 2001 Yield %

x Line 2002 Yield %

x Line 2003 Yield %

x Line 2004 Yield %

x Line 2005 Yield %



Yield % is defined as (# of Good Parts) / (# of Good Parts + # of Bad Parts)



Data source is a periodic snapshot with all of the Lines basically UNION ALL (on top of each other).



Looker translates it into the SQL included in the attached file. SQL returns this error: Query execution failed: - SELECT list expression references mfg_cell_consolidated_hourly_snapshot.acl_line which is neither grouped nor aggregated at [4:19]

Need your help here on this ticket. Our Engineers have pushed and it's stalled with Google Support.  The case id is: 43553670.  Anything we can do to have more eyes on this and come to a resolution would help a ton. Please let me know how to proceed.  I'm going to loop in the DoiT ticket on the replies so we can keep track of it.

We've been working with Doit this week to triage a recent issue we're experiencing with Looker and I believe Doit has opened a case with Google to further investigate. Nothing that we're aware of has changed in our environments, but rendering PDF and PNG files/reports through Looker no longer works in Prod and our Staging environment. Rendering in both environments seems to have stopped functioning around the same time. We've read through Looker documentation online regarding rendering errors, but nothing we've tried seems to resolve the issue. If you could help escalate this case within Google, we'd appreciate it. Let me know if you need any more information.

Ricky, DoIT Team,

Support is working with engineering to identify the issue, however the customer is using an older version of looker that was phased out from the 22.0.X release and is harder to troubleshoot for support, the oldest supported version is 22.18.X.

Engineering is investigating if upgrading will resolve the issue and will update shortly. In the meantime, is there any reason the customer can't update to a newer release, can you work with them to upgrade to at least 22.18?



Please follow up in the case whether it'll be possible to upgrade, or if there is a reason it needs to continue running 22.0.X.



Regards.

We have a meeting with the customer on Friday at 10am CT. We are going over the Looker Studio Pro pricing and agreement. We will also over how to leverage support with DoiT, and setting expectations given the product is new, there's going to be some Google presence working with the GCP account team on supporting the customer, as processes continue to be established. It would be good to have Dion be in attendance to observe, and represent support.

I think we can just change your measures to dimensions `type: number` and spl parameter should still work. Would you try this out first? We can then use a table calc to get product.

Sift is discussing Looker pricing tomorrow but they seem to have brought more people than expected to the meeting. This request is to have a Looker expert in the call as backup. I spoke with Dion Edge and he has agreed to take this ticket. Thanks Dion!

We discussed the Data History Playback error you are observing, and the available documentation and similar errors I can find, and my hypothesis is that DHP only works after the datetime stamp in the application database assigned when DHP is turned on in Labs.

I will keep this ticket open and change the priority to Normal until I can be reasonable sure of my hypothesis or offer another explanation. It was great speaking with you today and please reach out if you have any other questions.

Thank you.

Hello Dion,

 I am very sorry for the confusion, I lost the access notification, and I could not enter your instance to review the issue.

 I would appreciate it if you could renew this access for me please, on the other hand, until before your last reply I have been monitoring your _doitinternational_ instance, but the link you sent me is from _bauhaus_, we are working with the bauhaus instance, is this correct?

 Again, I offer a sincere apology for these inconveniences.

Unfortunately, your initial suggestion does seem to answer my question :(



When we deploy looker templates, we make a POST request to this endpoint specifying the commit we want to deploy: /api/3.1/projects/{project}/deploy_ref_to_production?ref={commit_sha}

And I ask if there is any endpoint where we can make a GET request to retrieve the {commit_sha} currently deployed.

If there is, give me its name, and I'll figure everything out further.



For now, I don't see how a meeting can help here.

Ideally, we'd like to see not only the latest deployed commit but also the one before him.

Something similar to what we see on the Deployment Manager page, but in JSON via API instead of UI.

We'd like to hide this behind our own domain, at https://reports.looker.com.



nslookup feefopbl.cloud.looker.com

Server: 100.96.1.1

Address: 100.96.1.1#53



Non-authoritative answer:

Name: 7edd31d0-c385-4ead-83c9-b07674e4bf91.cloud.looker.com

Address: 34.147.36.71



We'd handle SSL within our edge, so not worried about that.



Can I simply CNAME reports.looker.com to either feefopbl.cloud.looker.com, it's own CNAME of 7edd31d0-c385-4ead-83c9-b07674e4bf91.cloud.looker.com or the IP address 34.147.36.71?



I'm guessing using the CNAMEs that already exist would be preferable given the change of an IP change outside of our knowledge.



And then changing this in the Looker general settings:

Our customer is looking to renew their Looker agreement with DoiT from direct. They are also looking at a potential separate Looker platform that is white listed, and would be net new from the renewal. General engineering support is needed. Dion has been connected with the customer on Looker Studio Pro and this would be a good fit.

Hello Dion,

 Happy Wednesday!

 Sorry I think that we are missing a piece of information here. My last memory I have from this discussion it was that we need a packet investigation from the customer side as Looker logs were not providing enough light about the issue, but I still don't have an update from you. Would you like to have a meeting today or tomorrow to setup our current status?

This doesn't work.



What you suggest is the last commit of the specified Git branch regardless of whether it's deployed, but we want to get the last deployed to production commit.



We need either of two options:

1. After we make a POST request to _/api/3.1/projects/walkme/deploy_ref_to_production?ref={commit_sha}_ have an ability to make a GET request that will return this _{commit_sha}_.
2. Have an endpoint which returns deployment history like on the screenshot of Deployment Manager that I posted earlier in the thread.



Once again: not latest on a Git branch, but latest deployed to production.

Hello Dion,

 As we discussed in our meeting here are the steps we need your customer to take on in order to get better insights on SFTP server:

 1. We need the packet capture logs for when the connection is established from the SFTP server. (Recommended tool: https://www.wireshark.org/)
 2. Customer must setup this from where the SFTP server is installed.
 3. Once customer have the logs customer must filter the messages for the Looker server and the IP of the SFTP server and by the type of traffic TCP and SSH.

 I'll wait the summary of the previous ticket we had from your side, thank you in advance!

I'm not sure if these specific Looker questions are answered by DoIT.



I've created a period-on-period view in Looker that allows me to compare any selected period to the previous equivalent period. I'd like to know the best way to chart this - I've set up a separate 'reporting date' such that the previous period can be overlaid on the same timeline as the selected period, but I'd like the single date filter on the dashboard to control 2 date filters at the same time.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Steeve and I will be assisting you with setting up a single date filter on the dashboard to control two date filters simultaneously.

After conducting a thorough research, I think using Looker's Relative Dates [1] feature, will allow you to create queries with rolling date values relative to the current date. With a relative date filter, you can display the selected period and previous period on the same chart or visualization without the need for a separate ""reporting date"" field. This provides a more efficient and streamlined approach to comparing different time periods.

Here are the steps to implement a relative date filter in Looker to allow comparison of any selected period to the previous equivalent period, while still using a single date filter on the dashboard:

1. Open the dashboard that contains the period-on-period view in Looker.
2. Click on the date filter that you want to modify.
3. In the ""Filter"" section, change the filter type to ""Relative"".
4. Check the box ""Allow Users to Override Relative Dates"".
5. In the ""Value Format"" section, select ""SQL"".
6. In the ""SQL"" section, enter something like the following:
`BETWEEN dateadd({{view.period}}, -1, {{dashboard.datefilter_field}}) AND {{dashboard.datefilter_field}}`
_Please make sure to replace_ _""view.period"" with the name of the period field in your view, and replace ""dashboard.datefilter_field"" with the name of the date field in your dashboard._
7. Save your changes.

Kindly let me know if that work for you.

We were able to fix the function internally by using one of the old version of Chromium however this is not the way we want to deal with the problem. We would like to use the latest/stable version of Chromium to not face to the possible security vulnerabilities.



Is there any incident reported to Looker regarding the Chromium - Looker(Ubuntu) compatibility issue? or Any solution Looker planning to bring into such as working with Chromium to report the problem to Chromium bug page and let them troubleshoot the issue? We would like to keep this ticket open to track the latest updates for the issue.

Hello Dion,

 No worries, I'll wait. Just let me know if you'd agree to downgrade the case issue level from high to normal or low, as it has been a slow chatting and high severity ticket must take 7 days for closure and in this one we have more than 1 month overdue. I'll keep treating the case as one of my top priorities, but we'll downgrade the level per our severities definitions. https://cloud.google.com/terms/looker/support#:~:text=software%20or%20hardware.-,3.%20ISSUE%20REPORTING,-A.%20Issue%20Severity

The size limit is a hard constraint. Your best bet is to load the data into a compliant database where size limits don't apply.

Hello Dion,

 I have tried to reproduce the issue from my side, and I have these results which I attached as 42878497_001 and 42878497_002. Could you confirm if this is the format you expect to see in both SQL Runner and Explore please?

 I would like to try this by doing sudo with the user who is seeing this issue to rule out that it is a user configuration problem but I did not find any user similar to Dion or Edge, with which user could we try to replicate the issue?

Context:

Cherre has invested a lot of time and effort into Looker and we have several full time looker developers. However, we're finding that in term of embedding looker into our web platform, we're seeing significant difficulties. We believe that Power BI is a much better solution for Cherre if Looker does not keep up, which we belive is the case.



Therefore, we're planning to drop Looker once the current contract ends, and are already investing in acive development and restructuring our team to reduce reliance on Looker and increase reliance on Power BI.



Request:

Given that our Looker contract ends on Jan 2024, there's still time to turn this around. We're seeing a conversation with a Looker product manager, if they are interested in understanding the pain points and have the power to implement changes in the product. The relevant person on Cherre's side is Our Chief Product Officer Kevin Mattice (kevin@cherre.com).

Hello Dion,

 Thank you for your message.

 Currently the latest stable version that looker supports is version v97.0.4692.71-1.

 Going back to that specific version should looker to work as expected, please let me know if going back to this version is not feasible for your architecture and please be as descriptive as possible, this is to pass it on to our product engineering team so that they can understand better the impact of older versions is having on your business.

 Thank you for your help.

So, the pattern for User Attributes to parameterize database connections works for almost database except for GCP BigQuery because BQ uses a service account private key (the JSON file you attach to the connection). I did find this workaround that I am testing today but I thought I should share it now.


    There is a workaround using model sets, however. In this set up, we'll create multiple connections (1 per BQ project) and within out LookML project, 1 model per connection. We will then define our explore in a view file, or a .explore.lkml file (as these do not require a defined connection).Model file 1:include: ""bq_base_explores.view.lkml""connection: ""bq-project-1""Model file 2:include: ""bq_base_explores.view.lkml""connection: ""bq-project-2""View file/explore file (bq_base_explores.view.lkml) :explore: abcexplore: xyzWe will then define 2 model sets, one with permissions to model 1 and one for model 2, and assign these to users who would fall into our different UA groups. Our explores will be available to both sets of users, but will be queried against different connections depending on the user.


Please let me know your thoughts.

Thank you.

I have a question about some filter functionality in Looker. Let's say I have a table called fact_survey_response that contains records for feedback surveys that users complete and it has a grain of one row per user per survey response that a user submits. A single user can submit many responses.



A user belongs to an organization, and each organization can have a ""trusted"" relationship with X number of other organizations.



Assume we have:

- fact_survey_response - one row per user per survey response that a user submits, this has a score value of 0-10.
- dim_organization - one row per organization with org attributes
- bridge_organization_to_trusted_organization - one row per organization per organization they trust



I want to be able to show data from an explore based on fact_survey_response, filtered by the trusted organization, but **without increasing the grain of fact_survey_response when joining to the trusted organizations**. I'm imagining a way to select a value in a Looker filter and it creates a query like this:

    SELECT <useful columns>
    FROM fact_survey_response
    WHERE survey_organization_id IN
        (SELECT trusted_organization_id FROM bridge_organization_to_trusted_organization WHERE trusted_by_organization_id IN(<list of filter input values>))

Is this possible with Looker filters? It seems like there are ways to make the filters dynamic but I can't quite figure this one out.



Here's a visual of the relationship between these entities, if that helps! Thanks!

I downloaded the multiple value visualisation from the Looker marketplace: https://wiqcom.cloud.looker.com/marketplace/view/viz-multiple_value



But the font it uses seems to be different to the default font used in Looker, which make the visualisations look inconsistent. How can I change this font?

Recursion Pharmaceuticals is currently consolidated on GCP with us.

They are investigating Looker Studio Pro (potentially Looker as well) and want to push to a PoC/testing relatively soon.

I’m needing some pre-sales assistance to cover questions they have, primarily focused around:
1. Enterprise Management/Security Features
2. Primary userbase will be data science/engineers - not business users

1. Using the scheduler within Looker to send a dashboard to Slack, we can no longer send to a user. Sending to a channel still works.
2. Using a custom script that updates schedules in Looker
3. When specifying a destination of a Slack channel, it no longer works to enter the channel as say #data-mgtmt-reports, but have to use the channel ID eg C03Q654PRB6
4. When specifying a destination of a Slack user, it no longer works at all. It was working by entering the user as say @bwickersheim but neither this or the user ID works now.



These are new issues. Everything had been working for several months.



Item 1 has nothing to do with our custom system, so the issue there is within the Looker Slack connection.



fyi, a couple of snippets from the custom python script:



    from looker_sdk import models40
    sdk = looker_sdk.init40()



    if schedule['destination'] == 'Slack Channel':
        destination_type = 'looker-integration://1::slack'

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 43379987 for has been updated.

Case Subject: Schedule reports from Looker instance failing

Case Comment :

José, sorry for very late summary but I think we should review this together and then set up a meeting with the customer. Please, let me know what you think. /dion

###############################################

Problem: Some scheduled Looks, but not all, are being killed by the SFTP server with a Looker generated error (paraphrased) remote host killed connection due to timeout.



Database: PostgreSQL 9.6 (default timeout is 30s but if the db is killing the query, I think we would get a SQL error in Looker, which we are not. I think the SFTP server is killing the query but I could be wrong (if the SFTP timeout is NULL, default is also 30s).

Investigation: We see the same timeout errors in the looker instance admin/scheduled_jobs and confirmed:



Same error

Multiple users

Different frequencies

40s timeouts



So, we picked one Look that was failing and observed:



No results returned

No database or LookML errors

No LookML errors in the model or view files

No unusual or complex LookML (weird syntax, extends, etc)

We turned on debug logging last evening so I am trying to focus on a recent event. Based on start and end times in this event, I have attached the syslog and auth.log. The logs include customer names etc. which should be covered under our NDA but please do not share with external parties.

```List of errors:

1. User Chethan Sindhie is not enabled. Contact your Looker administrator to re-assign this scheduled report to an enabled user.

2. Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp-prod.shopwithgolf.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout Job ID

1221817

3. Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed due to error: NoMethodError. message: undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass Job ID

1221731

4. Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed due to error: NoMethodError. message: undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass Job ID

1221630

5. Upload to SFTP host sftp://ftp.verabradley.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout Job ID

1221522

6. Upload to SFTP host sftp://ftp.verabradley.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout Job ID

1221523

7. Authentication to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user beautycounter_returns@sftp.narvar.com. Job ID

1221412

8. Upload to SFTP host sftp://216.107.192.79:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout Job ID

1221414

9. Authentication to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user parkerny_returns_reports@sftp.narvar.com. Job ID

1221240

10. Authentication to SFTP host sftp://test-sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user test_sftp@test-sftp.narvar.com. Job ID

1221188

11. Authentication to SFTP host sftp://test-sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user test_sftp@test-sftp.narvar.com. Job ID

1221185

12. Authentication to SFTP host sftp://test-sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user test_sftp@test-sftp.narvar.com. Job ID

1221183

13. Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp-prod.shopwithgolf.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout Job ID

1220920

Above is the list for failed jobs regarding SFTP, except for no. 1 which is not related at all but I do see a big number of failed jobs because of this issue ""User 'SEVERAL USERS' is not enabled. Contact your Looker administrator to re-assign this scheduled report to an enabled user."" So it will be good for Narvar to check those users and enable them or not, depending on their needs. Now, regarding the SFTP, I do see more success SFTP jobs than failed, I know this is not a sustained issue but the second common issue I see is this ""Authentication to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed for user: Authentication failed for user 'SEVERAL USERS'"" this is an issue with credentials that Narvar needs to solve on their end if it's the case or it may be that users are not properly entering the credentials for your SFTP.

Then, I do see some errors with:

""Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp-prod.shopwithgolf.com:22 failed due to error: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout. message: Net::SSH::ConnectionTimeout""

""Upload to SFTP host sftp://sftp.narvar.com:22 failed due to error: NoMethodError. message: undefined method `write' for nil:NilClass""

I'll investigate those ones and let you know my findings ASAP. But please, could you let me know how many times they do see failed sftp deliveries and when they see them do they go to https://narvar.looker.com/admin/scheduled_jobs page and check the reason of why it failed? ```

I would like you advice in a flow we currently have where Looker queries Snowflake.

The flow is that we have a view that is linked to a table with sql_table_name, and multiple dimensions and measurements with CASE WHEN with some basic logc. Lastly, a model that is wrapping it with a simple exposure with a simple filter.

Then, we have a php server that calls Looker API and queries that model with 6-7 filters.

This flow works well in terms of functionality, except the query generated is very complex, one that takes Snowflake up to 7 seconds to just parse.



We have escalated this to Snowflake, but i believe they will come back to us questioning about the query.



I was able to pin down the problematic dimension causing the issue (which we also pivot on):







      dimension: order_for_period {
    	    view_label: ""Timeline Comparison Fields""
    	    label: ""Period Order""
    	    description: ""...""
    	    type: string
    	    sql:
    	       {% if current_date_range._is_filtered %}
    	         CASE
    	           WHEN {% condition current_date_range %} ${event_raw} /*findme6*/{% endcondition %}
    	           THEN 1
    	           WHEN ${event_raw} between ${period_2_start} and ${period_2_end}
    	           THEN 2
    	           WHEN ${event_raw} between ${period_3_start} and ${period_3_end}
    	           THEN 3
    	           WHEN ${event_raw} between ${period_4_start} and ${period_4_end}
    	           THEN 4
    	         END
    	       {% else %}
    	         NULL
    	       {% endif %}
    	       ;;
    	  }



where a period looks like that



      dimension: period_4_start {
    	    view_label: ""_PoP""
    	    description: ""Calculates the start of 4 periods ago""
    	    type: date_time
    	    sql:
    	          {% if compare_to._parameter_value == ""Period"" %}
    	              DATEADD(hour, -(3 * (${hours_in_period} + 1)), DATE({% date_start current_date_range %}))
    	          {% else %}
    	              DATEADD({% parameter compare_to %}, -3, DATE({% date_start current_date_range %}))
    	          {% endif %};;
    	    hidden: yes
    	    convert_tz: no
    	  }



the result is huge (attached one block of CASE it generates)



Basically what it does it creates time buckets (periods) and pivots on it.



Question is where there is a simpler implementation to it?

We're doing some user clean-up and have a question about users with both email and google authentication set up.



Reading through Looker documentation, it appears as if users with only google authentication don't automatically have their Looker accounts disabled when they leave our org, but we aren't concerned about their continued access since once their google authentication is revoked, they shouldn't be able to log into Looker.



What we aren't sure about is some of our early users who were first set up with email authentication and now also have google authentication. Once they leave the org and their google authentication is revoked, will their access via email authentication still allow them access to Looker? If so, how do we remove their email authentication access?

Also, we appear to have a Catherine Huang (cathuang@looker.com) from Looker as a User with an enabled account although she has never logged in. Is this normal or can we disable this account?

Thanks so much for responding. I'm not sure you could see the screenshot I included in the ticket, but here's another with an example. In this screenshot, Jad and me have both Email and Google authentication accounts while Jennifer is only Google. There aren't two distinct accounts with each type of authentication set up.



We have a few folks with this set up, and we'd like to know if the user's Google account has been revoked, would they still be able to access Looker through their email authentication? If so, we'd like to remove the email authentication, but keep the Google authentication. I can't see an obvious spot to make this change in the User record, and I couldn't find any documentation online. Any thoughts on this?

We are starting to make a few changes in our GA4 model in Looker, after not really looking at it for some time.

Currently we have no form of version control here, which isn't ideal, especially when we inevitably produce a bug.

Is there someone that can help us set this up?



I've heard previously that it's not possible/straight forward, so hoping one of your Looker experts has a solution for us!

I am working on a dashboard which identifies anomalies. Once an anomaly is detected, it is stored in a table with the information of the person we need to notify including their email (please see attached screenshot). I am trying to set up a dynamic way to send an alert or a schedule delivery to the person using the listed email address only when there is an anomaly related to that person.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Derrick, and I am helping Andrea with this request.

I understand that you are looking for a way to dynamically send Looker Studio dashboard to individual email users.

There are currently two Looker Studio versions:

- **Looker Studio** - it used to be known as Data Studio, which is a free product without support from Google. Thus we at Doit will only provide **best-effort level support**.
- **Looker Studio Pro** - it is a new product that was launched last December. It adds more features to the free version, enhanced enterprise capabilities, and technical support.

For more details on the Pro version, you can check these links [1] [2] [3].

To start my investigation, I have a few questions:


- Could you clarify which Looker Studio version you use in your company?
- Where do you get the anomalies data, and where do they get stored? (BigQuery?)

Thanks, and I look forward to your reply.

I am not using Looker Studio Dashboard but we have access to the free version of Looker Studio Dashboard. I am using Looker dashboard ( https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/looker-releases#release_23.4 ).



Regarding the data source, I am using PRIMA+ model in bigquery to detect anomalies and save the result in a table in google cloud platform. Then I have a view for that table and I am using that view to create the looker dashboard.



I am open to use a different approach in creating the dashboard if it makes it easier to set up the alerts. Please let me know if it makes sense and if you have any other question.

We have no visibility into any thing wrong with looker or logs with errors or anything - reports just aren't executed and delivered ... our merchant complains to support - Matthew's team executes them manually and they execute and deliver inside 4 minutes successfully

- Please re-engage with the customer (Matthew), garner read access to Looker instances in question (see previous ticket)

- Please reopen Google ticket and engage with them as well.

Hello Dion,

 I hope you are doing well!

 I'm reaching out here as it seems we've been having issues when connecting for the call. I've been discussing this ticket internally and we will need the packet capture from customer's side, and I understand you are working on getting those done.

 Another point I wanted to discuss during our call is that maybe we can close this ticket and once you gather customer's packet capture you can spin up a new ticket and ask if it is possible to assign it to the previous owner (me, current ticket reference: 43379987). This is to better aligned for better support practices as we are not allowed to have a ticket opened for more than certain time.

 I'll go ahead and mark this ticket as closed but feel free to share your thoughts on this email so it will be reopened. In case you agree with the proposed plan feel free to open a new ticket providing this ticket reference.

 Thank you.

As this continues to be an issue. I am going to try and get our old case reopened and Google engaged once again to get some eyes on what might be happening here.

Last we left off Google was looking to get support access to your looker instance so they could do further investigation. Could we get that enabled while I get our case opened back up and drive some engagement there? We may get a different support engineer and may need to add their user to the ""Technical support"" allow list. I will be in touch if we need to add additional users.

 Hello Ken,

Your Case 44149046 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Looker Reports using GDrive Action Fail to Complete Regularly

Case Comment :

Hello Sandra,

Apologies for the reopen here. This customer has escalated this issue to us again as its still occuring and causing issues. I believe they had hoped it was resolved as they had not seen it happen for a week or so, but that is not the case.

I am looking to pick up where we last left off and get you ""technical support"" access to this looker instance. I will reply back once I get confirmation that the steps below have been completed

Open Admin -> General -> Support Access.

Select """"I understand that by enabling Support Access..."""" checkbox.

Click the """"Enable Support Access"""" button to enable the support.

Click the """"Add users to Allow list"""" button and Looker will display the Add users to allowlist dialog.

Add my email (rangelgalaviz@google.com), select """"Technical support"""" at Reasons for access and Select the """"I agree"""" checkbox.

Click the """"Add to allowlist"""" button.""

Please review your case and take any actions as requested. If you have any questions or require immediate assistance, please reply to this email to contact Google Cloud Support.

    parameter: filter_value {
     type: string
     default: ""default_value""
    }

    # Use the parameter in a filter
    filter: example_filter {
     field: example.field_name
     value: ${filter_value} # Use the parameter value as the filter value
    }

In trying to figure out how to implement this we did the following:

1. We added the access_filter: to one of the explores in the dashboard in question.

> explore: product_activity_daily_summary_fact {

>  description: ""Join product_activity_daily_summary_fact to just the product_dim""

>  access_filter: {

>   field: product_dim.vendor_name

>   user_attribute: vendor_name

>  }

To do this we had to create a user_attribute as well. I'm not certain that this is what you had in mind, so first question is confirming that we are on the right path with that part.



Then we tried to add a 'parameter' section to the dashboards lookml, but we could not seem to get correct syntax for that. Is that where the parameter section goes?



Third question would be to verify how we would add this to the url when we sign and then call the url? I'm assuming if the parameter is called vendor_name it would be added as a query parameter of ?vendor_name='doit' but I'd like confirmation of that.

Hello Dion,

 This is following up on my last message.

 Our product engineering team is working  on the behaviour however at the moment the only supported version is v97.0.4692.71-1, while our team is evaluating if thiss version will be updated soon, there is no SLO or  any date in which I can confirm this will change, so our best path is to change Chromium version to  v97.0.4692.71-1.

 Please let me know if you have any further questions or if it's okay to close this case.

Best

Your looker license costs and quantities are as follow:

- Viewer: total 40 users, 30$ per user per month
- Standard: total total 13 users, 60$ per user per month
- Developer: total total 7 users, 125$ per user per month
Attached the contract for your convenience

Regarding your report:
I saw it, unfortunately due to many discrepancies between looker and google billing console, DoiT Console (aka CMP) is not supporting looker since last year. (it is in our product roadmap to support it again)

What you can do is use the looker system activity dashboards to see your user numbers:
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/system-activity-dashboards
The user roles are defined by their permissions as shown here:
https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-users-roles

Does this help?

Our team can provide you further assistance in figuring out your user quantities.

Awaiting your output.
Thank you,

Hi Ana,

 Sorry for the wait, I have lost access to the instance.

 Could you add my email romeronunez@google.com to your instance again,  please?

 Also, I would really appreciate it if you share the link of the dashboard with which you have problems, so that I can analyze it in depth.

 Regards,
 Chris R.,

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Tyler, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you're encountering an issue reinstalling the Crashlitics Looker plug from the marketplace, and per the referenced support article, created a ticket with Google on the matter.

It appears at this point to be a Git/Looker issue, and you're looking for more guidance, particularly from somebody familiar with your instance.

Dion is out of the office today, but will be back tomorrow and said he can continue helping with this.  Given his vast expertise on the subject, I think that would be a safe route to take.

Are you able to wait until tomorrow morning for Dion's assistance, or do you need it escalated more immediately within Google?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

I'm trying to tackle something that is not natively available on Looker which is the limiting of cross filtering to certain tiles.



To be more specific, my problem is as follows.



I currently have a dashboard containing some data relating to transactions.



The data is broken down into market categories of which there a dozen, each containing ~1-40 merchant categories.



For both of these entities I have things like average dollar spend and number of transactions which I would like to be able to show specifically for each merchant category or market segment that is selected on screen via the cross filtering ability.



I have screenshots below to demonstrate my current output.



 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/KVy5rEuzldpu8eHm45z6XHeKy/?name=oskyurbd.png)




So in the first image I have the market segment of retail selected in top left tile which cross filters to the specific merchant categories in the bottom left tile.



Furthermore it filters both the right tiles to show the transactions and average spend values for this market segment.



 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/1x0oTJjmPXkKPPIFly7D3Kl6S/?name=lhkfiyea.png)


Now in this second image I have the merchant category selected from the bottom left tile of discount stores.



What this does is filter both the right tiles which is my problem.



My intended functionality is for the top right tile to ignore this cross filter as it references the market segment and not the merchant category (which the bottom right tile is for).



Ideally I would like the cross filtering of the market segment to affect the bottom left and top right tile while the cross filtering of the merchant category only affect the bottom right tile.



Hence my issue is that the cross filtering is universal and not specific for each tile which is something I would like to try achieve.



What i have tried so far is playing around with a few case statements as filters but i have no been able to progress much.



I have researched online and found a single comment outlining that they used filters to achieve this.



Here is the link with the last comment being the one i am talking about -



https://community.looker.com/dashboards-looks-7/cross-filtering-some-tiles-not-all-of-them-27772



Any help would be appreciated regarding this!

I was thinking something along the lines of checking if there is a filter selected using the matches_filter function on the market segment or merchant category dimensions and building some conditional output on that.



However, I quickly found that the matches_filter function is limited to having a string input for its second argument alongside the fact that I don't think something that is not filtered on can have its filter value checked.



Beyond what I explained previously - there are probably a few edge cases where the dash will be break too so I'm quite stumped with what a robust solution can be.



Looking forward to what you can put together!

Data Analytics / Looker conversation –

We’re being asked to participate in a very short partner bakeoff window tomorrow May 3rd from 3:15 to 3:30 CDT. I’m planning on giving a very short pitch, then letting them ask their questions, for which it would be really helpful to have some engineering expertise on the line.

We got some very fragmented notes from the Google team, here’s what I know about the customer:

- Recently migrated from aws to google cloud data warehouse
- Using postgres
- High priority project to migrate to a proper data warehouse
- They also have some services on digital oceans (Initially was aws)
- Would like a better BI tool using metabase
- Would like to collab w/ Google to use Startup Credits
- They are interested in using their Startup credits (100k) towards Looker for internal reports. Not currently looking at BigQuery, but are leveraging the CloudSQL for Postgres

Hello Dion,

 Hello Ana,

 I wish you have a great Friday.

 Could you let us know if you still present this issue in your instance? If so, I would be happy to support you in whatever is necessary.

 In case you still have this problem, I hope you can grant me access to your instance to my email romeronunez@google.com, it would also be helpful if you share the link of the dashboard, so we can take a look.

 Thank you for your help and an apology for the inconveniences that have arisen on this ticket.

 Happy weekend,
 Chris R.

My name is Asad, and I work along with Dion, and I understand that you have renamed your project, but the renamed does not seem to take effect.

While I try to reproduce this on our side, can I ask you to log out and log back in, and if that does not work, please exit out of your browser completely and relaunch browser and log in

Can you walk me through how you are changing the name?

The best way to change would be to go into the project and use the Project Settings for project name change.  To change the model name, it should be done within the project by right click on the model name click ""rename"".

If you do it from LookML Projects screen it is confusing and will create additional projects.

Tere Espinosa has reached out to me regarding this issue. She has requested that we bump this to a P1 since it has taken so long to get answers as to the problem. I will be escalating our GCP case to a P1 per her instructions.

She asked if we could get our new case engineer support access to this Looker instance (like we did prior for Sandra). Hoping to get some extra traction here to help get this annoying issue resolved.


> I apologize for the late response and the inconveniences this issue is causing you.

Hello Ken,

 I'm Alejandro S - TSE for Looker - Google Cloud support, current on call resource and I'll be taking over this request.

 It seems the customer requested the case to be escalated to a P1 but due to familiarity with impact (I was owning the SME consult) I will change priorities to match our Support Service guidelines accordingly. (S3 - Tolerable: The Services are usable, non-critical functionality or components are affected, most operations are unaffected.).

 Having said that, I believe Sandra previously requested my email (alexsalmon@google.com) to be added to the Support Access allowlist - can we confirm that has happened so I can log into the instance and further investigate the behavior?

 So far the TSG team has been investigating on the customer's instance logs as well as the Action Hub server logs to try and find a Root cause for the delayed or failed schedules but we've not been able to find any smoking guns that could point to a root cause - this is the main reason we think that accessing the instance via Support Access is the best next step.

 Some additional information that could prove helpful is the following:

- Do schedule plans 184 and 185 fail each time they run or is the behavior sporadic?
-  Are we able to replicate the failure by clicking on ""Send now"" or testing the schedule?
- Which user created these schedules? (This is so we can sudo as the user and take a look at the Schedule settings).

 Please let me know if you have any questions and rest-assured this ticket has the highest visibility it can now have on the Looker end - we will only need the customer to provide the required resources for us to be able to find resolution.

Hello Matthew,

 Thank you for the details and provided access - I have just confirmed I am able to access the instance. Please make sure access is enabled for at least 1-2 weeks and that my colleague (linnali@google.com) is also on the allowlist.

 As a first high level scan of your instance, schedule and Action settings I can't see any smoking guns or misconfiguration, I was able to extract each run for scheduled plans 184 and 185:

https://analytics-cdn.recurly.com/admin/scheduled_jobs?scheduled_plan_id=184
 https://analytics-cdn.recurly.com/admin/scheduled_jobs?scheduled_plan_id=185

All seem to complete successfully and even have pretty standard runtimes, I will continue investigating the application logs for each of the outlined runs to see if I can find any strange behavior.

 Out of the runs outlined in the provided URLs, could you help me point out the Job ID of the ones we know either failed or delivered after multiple hours?
 We can get the Job ID by clicking on the ""Details"" button to the right of the Schedule History, a good source of information would be to provide the following format:

 Job_ID1 : description of unusual behavior
 Job_ID2 : description of unusual behavior

 Having specific Job IDs and experienced behavior will provide helpful context for investigating the Application logs and Action Hub server.

 Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Renato, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you have scheduled exports for 5+ Looks and some of them showing different delivery hours even though all of them are point to 6:00 am.

According to Looker documentation [1]:


> _The **Application Time Zone** is the default time zone for_ _content deliveries__. The time zone used for content deliveries does not affect time-based data returned by a query; it affects only the time a data delivery is sent._
>
>
>
> _If you enable the_ _**User Specific Time Zones**_ _option, the **Application Time Zone** is the default time zone for users that do not have a time zone value set for their accounts._


Can you check the Application time zone set for this user and if the User Specific Time zone is enabled?

The most recent one to have trouble is called subscriber balance. If you search for subscriber balance there's only two schedules named.  All of the jobs for LA times and San Diego Tribune, run on looks that are on a board under the recurly export user.

The specific reports an issue are variable, 184 and 185 are just two that seem to have a problem.  But not all of them have had trouble.  The most recent one to have trouble is called subscriber balance. If you search for subscriber balance there's only two schedules named.  All of the jobs for LA times and San Diego Tribune, run on looks that are on a board under the recurly export user.   But you'll find that there are no errors for any of those.  maybe you'll want to wait until Monday until I have further information, but I didn't want to be on responsive.  M C

Hello Ken,

 I have gone through the previous executions (up to a month) of each schedule that failed to deliver on time and here are my observations:

- The deliveries complete successfully after the time stated in the Schedule History page.
- On the Action Hub server I can see one of multiple tries for several of the schedules - the complete action from the AH server takes no longer than 1 minute in most schedules and we receive no errors.
- Since all scheduling is happening on a single user I theorized that there could be throttling due to us hitting the Per user query limit. I quickly refuted this idea because the schedules seem to be triggering and completing within 2 minutes on both Looker and Action Hub.
 This observations make me think that we may be hitting a Drive/Workspace issue with either throttling or the streaming of results - there's no indication on the Looker or AH side that could shed some light as to why deliveries take over 6 hours to show up on drive.

 For next steps I would like to test the Drive delivery to a work folder I own to be able to track the timing of the delivery and replicate the issue on command. Please let me know if you'd approve of this as a further Action Hub troubleshooting step or if you have any questions.

We found that from Looker interface and not the embedded interface there’s a Timezone option when setting up schedule. Can you confirm that when selecting New York(Eastern Time) for example, the schedule time will move with the daylight saving changes on Eastern Time?

Our Google support engineer and the case manager was hoping to get approval to perform the additional testing described in their last update to this support case. Is this something you would be willing to approve for them to continue their troubleshooting on this very elusive problem? Providing an approval either in response to this request on the Google support case (made on Tuesday of this week) or here, I can then forward that approval over to their team. We appreciate your patience with this issue as it gets worked.



> I have gone through the previous executions (up to a month) of each schedule that failed to deliver on time and here are my observations:
>
>
>
> - The deliveries complete successfully after the time stated in the Schedule History page.
> - On the Action Hub server I can see one of multiple tries for several of the schedules - the complete action from the AH server takes no longer than 1 minute in most schedules and we receive no errors.
> - Since all scheduling is happening on a single user I theorized that there could be throttling due to us hitting the Per user query limit. I quickly refuted this idea because the schedules seem to be triggering and completing within 2 minutes on both Looker and Action Hub.
>
> This observations make me think that we may be hitting a Drive/Workspace issue with either throttling or the streaming of results - there's no indication on the Looker or AH side that could shed some light as to why deliveries take over 6 hours to show up on drive.
>
>
>
> **For next steps I would like to test the Drive delivery to a work folder I own to be able to track the timing of the delivery and replicate the issue on command. Please let me know if you'd approve of this as a further Action Hub troubleshooting step or if you have any questions.**

From my understanding Google would like to configure the drive delivery to a work folder they own so they can more closely track and monitor delivery delays. We can of course request additional information on what they will do and what it will entail.

If the issue is related to Looker and the surrounding services, I would expect any payload to possibly experience this issue. Do you have lower env test data/payloads that are not customer prod data that can be used for this troubleshooting/test?

I would agree that using customer data/jobs for the test is not the right decision here. The goal, from my understanding, is to attempt to recreate this issue of delivery (regardless of the payload) to a folder Google has more insight into.

If you could read through this thread, I'd like to create a report for the google user who has support access, that they have access to but can't edit, using their user attribute site_id as a filter set to sales demo.  A simple report built on one of the dw_analytics models, maybe on transactions with detail, so it has some size.  The only part I don't know is whether we can lock the report down to prevent from removing the user attribute filter.  They would be able to schedule the report to a gdrive folder they have access too.  Can you review the request and provide feedback on feasibility?

This is the Google Cloud Account Manager for AbleTo. We have conveyed to the AbleTo leadership the following: _""Our product engineering team is working  on the behaviour however at the moment the only supported version is v97.0.4692.71-1, while our team is evaluating if thiss version will be updated soon, there is no SLO or  any date in which I can confirm this will change, so our best path is to change Chromium version to  v97.0.4692.71-1.""_



And we have also recommended an alternate option to migrate their self managed Looker instance to Looker managed instance (SaaS).



We have another call tomorrow to reconfirm our position. If either is not acceptable to them,  then I am not sure we have any other alternate solution at this time.



Kind Regards

Hello Ken,

 We're still digging the behavior but are unable to find failures on the Looker or Action Hub end. Are we still experiencing the same behavior? Were we able to set up a testing environment to confirm whether or not this  related to Looker?

 Please let me know if you have any questions.

Our Looker instance seems to be quite slow recently. We've noticed that many queries are finishing within 2-3s but the reports take around 8s+ to fully render for the same queries.



This is especially important as we are planning to bring up to 100+ additional users from the Connexity and want to ensure that all Looker users have very smooth experience. There were user complaints about the speed of the Looker and we would like to address these comments.



I've recently discussed this topic with Thomas Linley and the Google and DoiT team during our monthly call but did not hear back from them yet.



Can you help us add additional resources to our Looker instance to see if this is going to help?



In addition, can you provide more details on what instance size is utilised by our Looker instance? Is it possible to get any statistics on the CPU and memory usage of our Looker instance?

Looks like we would need an offline license for installation in an air gapped environment i. I raised a request to our sales ops team to modify the existing license but they can only grant a 90 days offline license.



@Zack Simkover/ @Jahan Kahusi - Could you please look into the matter? Harness has 5 such licenses and this was their 1st customer installation. We might need to modify the existing licences to the offline version and not just for 90 days. We can start with one license reported in this case for testing. Please consult with Rohit and the team to make the necessary changes.

Message from customer below. I can assist with the costing exercise, but wondering if CRE can help with a Looker Studio vs Looker Studio Pro demo / overview?

We have recently been going much deeper in using Looker Studio for operational dashboarding.
We are beginning to face some limitations on tracking which dashboards we have and being able to give users a single pane of glass to use to track dashboards (like what exists in Looker menus). There are some other challenges that Rob, my product analytics leader, can send over to you.
Can we get someone to do a demo on Looker Studio Pro vs. Looker Studio? Can we also get a frame on costing?

I think this might be due to the concurrent query limit for system activity queries. Without System Activity Elite, they will be limited to 1 query at a time. Besides that, I think usually issues with system activity explores are due to the size of the underlying database tables. Running a query in each explore, especially the history table, with a simple count could give us an idea here. If that is the issue, we would also have to reach out to GCP support to see if they can trim the tables, due to the performance issues that they are causing. This would mean, that the data wouldn't be available for the customer to analyse anymore.

Hello Ken,

 Thank you for flagging the new errors, I'll see if I can track a smoking gun either on the gDrive side, Action Hub or Looker.

 Seems like Support Access is no longer enabled, could you help me enable it once more?

 In case this issue is determined to be on the Google Drive side and we need to transfer the case, we would need a gSuite Super Admin account or for your account to have Super Admin permissions. This is just a note for visibility, I'll confirm if we need to transfer after investigating the schedules you shared.

 Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Any update on this? Were you able to chase down Looker Studio Pro pricing?



I'd also like to get some visibility into the API limits of our current Looker subscription. If I remember correctly from purchasing it at a past company, Looker has a limit on the number of API calls you can make and I need to know what those limits are and what the cost is if we exceed them.

Please, see:

https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Technical-Tips-Tricks/Why-are-my-System-Activity-queries-being-queued/ta-p/585263

Also, I think upgrading to System Activity Elite will resolve this issue but we can also trim the underlying history table to improve performance although you will lose those records.

Please, let me know how you would like to proceed.

Hello Ken,

 Thank you for the reply, we won't close the ticket while there's ongoing engagement - the received message was an automated email by GCP Support.

 Seems like Support Access is no longer enabled, could you help me enable it once more?

 In case this issue is determined to be on the Google Drive side and we need to transfer the case, we would need a gSuite Super Admin account or for your account to have Super Admin permissions. This is just a note for visibility, I'll confirm if we need to transfer after investigating the schedules you shared.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Dion,

 It's been some time without a reply from your side, I belive the workaround of going back to that specific Chromium version (v97.0.4692.71-1) has solved the issue.

 I'll go ahead and close the case but feel free to contact us back again in case there are any further questions or anything else we can help you with.

 It's been great working with you best.

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 43763992 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Looker RendererNoRenderFinishedEventReceivedError

Case Comment :

The customer will not revert to a Chromium version (v97.0.4692.71-1) that old as it will generate significant security issues. This was discussed with the customer, Google, and DoiT in a meeting. They are self hosted so it's most likely an issue dependent on their particular configuration and not an actual bug. I would like to review the notes on this issue for the same of closure.

Please review your case and take any actions as requested. If you have any questions or require immediate assistance, please reply to this email to contact Google Cloud Support.

Our Google case manager and support engineer have reached out to me curious if we are able to enable Support Access once again. It appears as though it either expired or was disabled.

The team was looking to continue their troubleshooting and engage an engineer from the Google Drive side of things.

Hello Dion,

 I understand the customer position.

 I've checked with our Product Engineering team and the change for this behaviour is expected to be on one of the next version release, the aim is 23.10 which is expected to be release on June 20th but I will need to confirm the version and date. This will allow looker to work with any of the Chromium versions.

 I'll update you once I have confirmation on the date

I hope this message finds you well.

It seems you were unable to meet for the call today but I would like to still offer some information that can help optimize your BigQuery environment.

As a general recommendation, it's strongly advised to utilize partitioned tables [1] in order to significantly enhance query performance. Partitioning offers several benefits, including reduced bytes scanned by queries, resulting in lower costs for those on on-demand pricing. For the BigQuery Editions (slot-hour) pricing model, partitioning decreases the amount of data that needs to be processed, leading to a reduction in slot utilization.

Once you've implemented partitioned tables, the next step is to potentially implement clustered columns [2]. Clustering enables BigQuery to optimize query performance by organizing your data into blocks, which facilitates a process known as block pruning (removal of un-related data). Automatic re-clustering [3] ensures that newly added data is appropriately grouped with the corresponding storage blocks. As a result, BigQuery can efficiently sort and group data, leading to faster and more cost-effective query execution. Please note, block pruning is as best effort and may not guarantee cost reductions but is still generally recommended by the BigQuery product team.

For enhanced performance of reports and dashboards, we recommend considering BigQuery BI Engine [4] for fast, in-memory data processing. Please be aware that BI Engine requires the allocation of reservations and may not be suitable for all scenarios. It's essential to compare the increased costs against the performance gains derived from using this feature.

Lastly, you may always reschedule another meeting via [5] and we can further discuss the above via Google Meets.

Hello Dion,
 The system__activity model is available for all instances, but by default it is based directly on your Looker instance's internal MySQL database, the same database that is used for internal operations on your instance. For example, whenever you run a query on your instance, Looker will run an INSERT statement to add a row to the history table in your internal MySQL database with the details of that query. The problem with this setup is that MySQL is a transactional database, which means while it is very optimized for performing the operations that make your instance run, it is not well-optimized to run analytical SELECT queries. For instances with a significant level of activity, some of the tables can become large enough that SELECT statements on those tables run very slowly.

 When Elite System Activity is enabled, we provision a BigQuery replica of your internal MySQL database to use for System Activity. BigQuery is better optimized to run these kinds of queries than MySQL, so the System Activity queries run against the BigQuery replica, while your instance's operations continue to be performed using the original MySQL database.

 (Since the i__looker model is deprecated in favor of the system__activity model, i__looker continues to run against the MySQL database even after ESA is enabled.
 You can change the model for your content based on i__looker over to system__activity using the methods in this help center article: https://help.looker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001288308-Changing-the-Model-or-Explore-of-a-Look)
 You can read more about challenges with transactional databases and the reasons to use a replica for analytics here: https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-transactional-databases

 I am not seeing any issues with the instance resource usage or any limitation being hit. Upgrading to the Elite System Activity will help resolve the performance issue with System Activity Explorers.

 Hope this is helpful. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.

Hello Ken,

 I'm Diego, Google Cloud TSE. I'll be taking this ticket moving forward as Alejandro is OOO for the coming weeks.

 I appreciate you were able to add some agents to Support Access. Apologies for bothering with this but could you add my email as well to the Support Access list? (**diegoslo@google.com**)

 I'm reading the whole ticket to understand the current status and provide next steps.

 I'll take a look at the logs as well and performance insights for the instance.

 If this issue has been happening lately, could you share some of the Webhook IDs that are shown in the errors? Example:

 Could not send webhook to
 ""https://actions-gcp.looker.com/actions/google_drive/execute"".
 Net::ReadTimeout: Net::ReadTimeout. (Webhook ID:
55e9126f87890a1d3b8ca6007817d692)

 Appreciate your collaboration,

 Respectfully,

Diego

We got the following requirement and would love to hear your input/ideas on how to solve the task in Looker:





Currently, we are working on the so-called Bluecode Engagement Hub, basically, it's a UI that combines functionality for sending in APP messages, push messages, and toggle banners within our app (see here to get an idea of what we are doing ;) ). Depending on the audience different messages/push/banners are displayed. Those messages could be recurring or triggered by some event eg. the user did his first transaction with our payment app.



Now the idea is to define the audience in Looker for example as Look and then connect them with the Engagement Hub. Data wise it's rather simple, the Engagement Hub needs to know only one id and from each user the same id.



Can you help us to develop a solution on the whiteboard that we can then implement?





Thanks in Advance

Greatly appreciate joining the meeting today. As discussed, I will reach out to a Looker specialist to further assist you in generating your reports. Please expect a response shortly.

In addition, please find below a summary of what we had discussed:

- For automating report generation, key products/services to consider would be BigQuery Scheduled queries [1], Cloud Composer [2] and Cloud Functions [3].
- Reports will be viewed in Looker Studio
- Prefer an out of the box solution

Cloud Composer would provide the most flexibility & features; however, this also causes it to be the most costly of the above options. As a sample, the following article [4] provides a brief overview of how another user leverages Cloud Composer/Apache Airflow to automate generating reports.

Cloud Functions can also provide similar features but would be limited when tasks need to harmonize with each other to form an orchestrated workflow. As a sample, the following article [5] provides an overview of automated reporting via Cloud Functions/Cloud Scheduler. The end results are viewed within Looker Studio (Formerly Data Studio).

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 45529734 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Customer requests increase in Looker instance size

Case Comment :

https://taboola.cloud.looker.com/

From the customer:

```Our Looker instance seems to be quite slow recently. We've noticed that many queries are finishing within 2-3s but the reports take around 8s+ to fully render for the same queries.

There were user complaints about the speed of the Looker and we would like to address these comments.

In addition, can you provide more details on what instance size is utilised by our Looker instance? Is it possible to get any statistics on the CPU and memory usage of our Looker instance?```

This looks like an increase in instance size would be be helpful here.

Thank you.

Hello Dion,
 Hope you are doing well!

 For _https://taboola.cloud.looker.com _we have the next performance charts:

 ![cpumemorytab](cid:1bfd2e0f-27ba-47ab-bfee-a5c3dd942d9b@Image_0_ ""cpumemorytab"")

As we can notice, the instance seems to be really helpful on the infra part. We are not hitting any limit.
 So I am sure that the problem with the ""long running queries"" is with the DB you are using and how it manages the load of queries.
 Could you please verify and confirm the next with me?:
 - A significant number Scheduled Tasks being triggered at the same time with gaps with less than 1 min. (Admin -> Schedule Plan and/or Schedule History)
 - Datagroups also being triggered at the same time as the scheduled tasks.
 - Heavy Dashboards trying to be rendered (with more than 25 tiles).

 Why the last?, because if the DB is busy trying to complete queries at the same time it can overwhelm it, so in case this is the issue, we will have to redesing the scheduled time of these tasks. Furthermore, if we are trying to render Dashboards with more than 25 tiles I will recommend to split it in two dashboards since it is not recommended to have Dashboards with more than 25 tiles.
 I can also suggest  checking  on _Admin -> System Activity -> Performance Recommendations _, this will give us some recommendations for our Looks/Explores/Dashboards that we can implement.

 ![dbp](cid:bb1ac63a-1cc2-49d2-83ea-0ed8e0e2c456@Image_1_ ""dbp"")

 ![dbp2](cid:dc795f7e-d792-4049-9b0a-dc4a703eed27@Image_2_ ""dbp2"")

 The last two images display the performance of your DB (the one that runs your queries), and as we can notice we have some little peaks, but I can consider that at the moment it is still not a big issue. So I will strongly recommend just to follow the performance recommendations on the Admin Panel that was explained above, and also if needed, the next doc about ""Optimize Looker Performance""(https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/how-to-optimize-looker-server-performance).

 Kind Regards.

Hello Dion,
 Just checking in this is a P3 issue now.
 Given that this requires customer approval to go to ESA and this is an expected issue, I will go ahead and close this issue for now.
 Once you confirmed with customer feel free to reopen this case or open a new case as needed.

We started using looker extensively to develop our BI layer.

Most things go smoothly but I'm encountering some git related issues of which I'm not sure of the root cause.



Sometimes, when on a branch (not main), you click on the button ""Pull Remote Changes"" instead of only getting the changes from the branch on remote, or even only those + main changes, you get changes for other branches (not main again), that then messes up the whole git history plus requires a revert commit.



Also on completely other topic, it seems the branch master is regenerated from time to time even though our main branch is main.



Does those issues ring a bell ?



Trying to figure out why this happens to prevent it from happening,

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 45529734 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Customer requests increase in Looker instance size

Case Comment :

Hi Mauro Alejandro,

I worked with the customer this morning and confirmed:

1. There is not a significant number of Scheduled Tasks being triggered at the same time with gaps with less than 1 min.
2. Datagroups are not being triggered at the same time as the scheduled tasks.
3. There are not a significant of Heavy Dashboards trying to be rendered.

Also, we created an example explore and an example dashboard to demonstrated the latency we are seeing:

a. https://taboola.cloud.looker.com/explore/skimlinks/warehouse?qid=y9UlgsR2IjXuihmm4v6M72

b. https://taboola.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/317?Date+Filter=2023%2F05%2F01+00%3A00+to+2023%2F05%2F10+00%3A00

Is there a convenient way to share the instance stats that you have access to? I do think increasing instance size should alleviate the performance drag. They are heavy Looker users and I think this is just a resource issue.

Please, advise.

Hello Dion,
 Hope you are doing well!

 Thanks for checking the last!
 But unfortunately, even if I increase your infrastructure resources to the double, we will still be getting the same behaviors because the problem is not there.

 ![tboola](cid:3a6cdc88-47d4-45e4-8562-2eeab0c20984@Image_0_ ""tboola"")

As we can see in the image, CPU Usage is not even near to 1 core and we have a limit of 6, and the Memory Usage still have a lot free space. In general all is healthy on this part.

 What I could recommend at the moment is just to optimize the queries, we can take a look to **_Admin -> System Activity -> Performance Recommendations_** in order to get the proper improvements we can apply to Explores, Looks and Dashboards.
 And also we can review the next article about Optimize Looker Performance.

 Why the last recommendations and not the upsize?
 Because the problem with the ""long"" running queries is not on the infra part, it is on the Database side, so if we want to make those queries to run faster, we will have to optimize them.

 Kind Regards.
 Mauro Alejandro

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Cecilia, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that when pulling remote changes on a branch (not main), changes from other branches are also being pulled, which is causing confusion and requiring revert commits.

The master branch seems to be regenerated from time to time, even though the main branch is 'main'. Let's address these issues one by one:


- **Pulling Remote Changes:** In Git, when you pull remote changes, it fetches the changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch. If you're seeing changes from other branches, it's possible that those changes were merged into the branch you're pulling from. It's also possible that the branches were not properly isolated, causing changes to bleed over from one branch to another. To troubleshoot this issue, you could check the commit history of the branches involved to see if there were any unexpected merges. You could also review the branch management practices to ensure that changes are properly isolated to their respective branches.


- **Regeneration of Master Branch:** By default, Git uses 'master' as the name of the main branch. However, it's possible to change the name of the main branch, as you've done in your case. If the master branch is being regenerated, it could be due to a script or process that's not aware of the name change and is still referring to 'master'. To troubleshoot this issue, you could review any scripts or processes that interact with your Git repository to see if they're still referring to 'master'. You could also check the settings in your Git client or on your Git hosting service to ensure that 'main' is set as the default branch.

Could you try the suggestions above and let me know the results, please?

Sincerely,

They rolled the instance back to version 23.8 but the issue persisted.

I then went over the shared code and error message and found that they were using a query_id to call the GET query_tasks endpoint. As per the documentation, the endpoint requires a query_task_id, not a query_id.

Afterwards I used the provided query_id in the POST query_tasks endpoint which generated a query_task_id.
When I used that query_task_id, the response body was returned with the status 200.

The assumption therefore was that somewhere in their script they are extracting and inserting the query_id instead of the query_task_id. The customer has started to go over their code, and the code that has been reviewed so far worked as expected in a local environment and also returned the query_task_id.

They are looking further into it, as their catalog application, which is utilizing the GET query_tasks endpoint, was moved to Kubernetes on Wednesday, it seems likely that it is related to that move and could potentially be a permissions issue.",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,0.9,21.1,1,1,57.3,"$34,084",1,1

    Here's the documentation on renewing an offline Looker license. I've also made the request to sales ops to open a ticket to request to extend the 90 day offline license renewal time.By default offline licenses expire in 90 days. The usual process to renew them is mostly manual and relies on the Offline License Renewal Portal.The customer must provide a member of the Support team with their License Key and looker.data file, which can be retrieved in a couple ways.The usual method is to use the ""Renew"" button on the Admin > General Settings page in the Looker UI. This will ""download"" the file, essentially just copying it to the downloads folder and renaming it license_data.If the license has already expired and the customer can no longer access their instance, they will need to manually retrieve the looker.data file from the Looker directory on their instance.Support will then input the License Key and data file into the Offline License Renewal Portal. This will download a new offline license file, which is then handed over to the customer.Note: It can take up to a minute for the renewal to complete. After it is successful, the link provided is valid for 24 hours and can be used to download the license file multiple times within the window.The customer installs the new license in one of two ways.The usual way is to upload the file using the UI on the General Settings page.Just like before it can also be done manually. The customer will need to rename the file to looker.license, place it in the same directory as their looker.jar file, and ensure it's owned and readable by the same user running the looker application.Zack SimkoverData Analytics Sales858-736-5385

Thanks for you answer,

Regarding the pulling remote changes part. Indeed changes are getting into branches they should. My issue being that it is not wanted and it is made purely using Looker UI.
Let's take an example. Here is a branch called `churn_dashboard_dev_06_2023`, and here is the history of the branch:
 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ynp5Dpf82OORUZqoC8ud9yWKx/?name=e408e841-b8f1-43f4-b011-9a7e79418a3c-spark-clipboard.png)

You can see that commit `5770d5dc5fe116172373e257f64ca9f9daf79af5` merges the branch `m_lefebvre_CRM_dev` and this was not intended. In the UI we just wanted to update, and purely clicked on buttons on the top right saying `Pull Remote Changes` and `Pull & Merge Other Changes`.
What I don't understand is then why does this branch get's taken into the merge as it is not wanted ?
I've seen this 3 times now so I'm looking to understand so that I can not reproduce it afterwards.

Regarding Master branch regeneration, i've deleted it once again last week, waiting to see if it gets regenerated.


Thank you very much for you answer, hoping to get to the bottom of this :)

Have a good day,

Thanks for the example, it's not very clear for me that is not the intended behaviour with the screenshot you have provided.

I can recommend you yo use PR Required [1] and/or Protect the branch [2] to avoid future problems.

If you want to deep dive on what happened before I can reassign the ticket to another colleague that might have a better insight of the problem.

Well here essentially I would have expected in the process only updates from main to be included in the merge, but here i have a third branch that gets merged somehow.

PR required is enabled, and main branch is protected. We were on a development branch here.

I am try to implement a fairly complex model in Looker ML. I am try to use ""bind_all_filters"" with native derived table. I have tried to follow the docs [1] but with no luck. I have found a work around at the moment but I will much more prefer use the ""bind_all_filters"" and Native Derivate Table.



I am going to explain what I am try to do using a SQL query.



    WITH
      density_reference AS (
      WITH
        density_reference_base AS (
        SELECT
          density_base.polygon_id AS polygon_id,
          density_base.purchasing_power_quantile AS purchasing_power_quantile,
          density_base.h3_key AS h3_key,
          COALESCE(SUM(density_base.devices ), 0) AS sum_devices,
          COALESCE(SUM(density_base.events ), 0) AS sum_events
        FROM
          `huq-annapurna.huq__test_client.density_output` AS density_base
          -- I want the same filter here and in the outer query --
        GROUP BY
          1,
          2,
          3
      )
      SELECT
        MIN(density_reference_base.sum_devices ) AS min_devices,
        MAX(density_reference_base.sum_devices ) AS max_devices,
        MIN(density_reference_base.sum_events ) AS min_events,
        MAX(density_reference_base.sum_events ) AS max_events
      FROM
        density_reference_base
      -- No filter here --
    )
    SELECT
      density.polygon_id AS density_polygon_id,
      density.centre_name AS density_centre_name,
      density.purchasing_power_quantile AS density_purchasing_power_quantile,
      density.h3_key AS density_h3_key,
      SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(density.devices), ( ANY_VALUE(density_reference.max_devices) )) AS density_devices_normalized_over_max
    FROM
      `huq-annapurna.huq__test_client.density_output` AS density
    CROSS JOIN
      density_reference
    -- I want the same filter here and in the very inner query --
    GROUP BY
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4



This is the result I want. Of course the SQL can be different as long as the logic is the same.



I have try to use bind filter creating multiple explores but I was not able to make it work. It would be nice to implement it with NDT and ""bind_all_filters"" at the moment I use a custom SQL derived table with filters injected via liquid but this creates friction in downstream development.



Thank you

Hello Dion,

 Hope you're doing well.

 It looks like today the issue returned. Everything was working as expected since June 6th.

 Today, there was a scheduled job with webhook ID (af1c2ec6e1a77337ab13bdde25a42a5d) that failed with Timeout.

 The quick workaround for this issue is to rerun the scheduled job. Appreciate the collaboration for this.

 I will report this ID with DevEng to see if we are dealing with a new bug. Recently, there have been several updates regarding Action Hub but, as this project will take time to complete, we will need to retry these scheduled jobs for now.

 Thank you for your understanding, will share any updates from DevEng.

 Best,

Diego

 Hello Dion,

Your Case 45529734 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Customer requests increase in Looker instance size

Case Comment :

Hi Mauro Alejandro!

PROBLEM: Looker looks and explores are experiencing significant rendering latency.

I met with several of the customer's engineering team including the Looker administrator. By process of elimination we eliminated the following potential causes of the appreciable latency in Looker's rendering:

1. Instance resources have significant headroom.

2. The query we used for our analysis performed nominally the same in Looker SQL Runner and the BigQuery Console.

- https://taboola.cloud.looker.com/explore/skimlinks/warehouse?qid=DKZx8uWjhWZcaakQgvVBea&toggle=vis

```WITH halfhourly_link_report AS (

-- Using daily table as filtering and date fields are less than one month

-- Date filter: '7 days ago for 7 days'

SELECT * FROM

`skim-insights.wh.daily_agg_link_report`

)

SELECT

halfhourly_link_report.normalized_page_url AS halfhourly_link_report_normalized_page_url,

publisher_domain_metadata.publisher_domain_name AS publisher_domain_metadata_publisher_domain_name,

publisher_domain_metadata.publisher_name AS publisher_domain_metadata_publisher_name,

COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.clicks ), 0) AS halfhourly_link_report_m_clicks,

SAFE_DIVIDE(COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.sales ), 0), COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.clicks ), 0)) AS halfhourly_link_report_m_conversion_rate,

COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.order_amount_gbp ), 0) AS halfhourly_link_report_m_order_amount_gbp,

COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.sales ), 0) AS halfhourly_link_report_m_sales,

SAFE_DIVIDE(COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.total_combined_commission_amount_gbp ), 0), COALESCE(SUM(halfhourly_link_report.clicks ), 0)) AS halfhourly_link_report_m_total_epc_gbp

FROM halfhourly_link_report

LEFT JOIN `skim-insights.mugic.publisher_domain_metadata`

AS publisher_domain_metadata ON halfhourly_link_report.publisher_domain_id = publisher_domain_metadata.publisher_domain_id

WHERE ((

((( halfhourly_link_report.date_ts ) >= ((TIMESTAMP_ADD(TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), DAY), INTERVAL -7 DAY))) AND ( halfhourly_link_report.date_ts ) < ((TIMESTAMP_ADD(TIMESTAMP_ADD(TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), DAY), INTERVAL -7 DAY), INTERVAL 7 DAY)))))

))

GROUP BY

1,

2,

3

ORDER BY

4 DESC

LIMIT 5000```

3. We also pulled the log file for the `query_id` and found nothing unusual.

```{""duration"":""0.000837"",""sql"":""SELECT * FROM `slug` WHERE ((`slug`.`query_id` = 93372) AND (`guid` = '8Q0CXIxpiU2cNmxsTu23MT')) LIMIT 1"",""h"":""192-168-0-91.looker.pod.cluster.local"",""n"":""Skimbit Ltd."",""nid"":93,""t"":""2023-07-06T16:17:08.587+00:00"",""s"":""INFO"",""rid"":""237ca32a882ec2d7"",""c"":""db:looker""}

4. We looked at scheduling and observed no bottlenecks.

5. The LookML is generating a fair number of Common Table Expressions but nothing outrageous.

To be quite honest, and I know rendering issues are opaque at best, this one has me stumped. Any insight into how to further troubleshoot or if I'm missing something obvious, please let me know.

Thanks!

Hello Dion,
 Hope you are doing well!

 Something I can add to the investigation is the post-processing time that Looker could take in order to finish rendering a Look/Dashboard, let me try to explain this point:
 First I have to mention that the _**Queries**_ page and **_query_summary _**doesn't account for the rendering time post query, that is why we could see the queries **_completed _**even when the Dashboard/Look is still loading.

**_Post processing, _**this includes:

- pivoting* (and sorting) for dialects that require in-memory pivoting
- stitching together main query data with total data
- window field post processing (percent of previous and whatnot)
- extents processing (binning used for automagic heatmap)
- sorting (if we need to sort on things like window field data)
- table calcs (if done by the server) + sorting if we need to sort on table calc data
- forecasting
- Custom Visualizations

All of these need to be done on the Looker server/browser itself, so the rendering of the final tile could be delayed to do that post-query processing. So I recommend checking on this too and see (in case we have) if we could reduce them.

Kind Regards,
 Mauro Alejandro

We have a Looker contract that started on January 1, 2023, however, I see that the billing changed in June with an amount of $5970 - I think I can understand the amount but why did it start to be billed in June while the contract started six months ago and it should have been billing every month.

The Frontend is written in Vue, and the embedding works with an iframe and an URL generated by one of our web services.



To improve the user experience, our application interacts in two ways with the embedded dashboards:

1. It adjusts the iframe height to the height required by the Dashboard, so the whole dashboard is visible on the page and there is only one scroll bar
2. When the user navigates to a new Dashboard inside the Dashboard, a back button is shown to safely return to the previous dashboard.



Both features rely on the Looker Dashboard sending message events that are then processed by our code. However, as far as I can tell, no messages at all are sent by the Dashboard.



I attached a screenshot and also our code that is embedding the dashboard. But the code is very similar to what is provided in the documentation https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/embedded-javascript-events. So our assumption is that there is a Bug on Looker side that prevents embedded dashboards to emit message events.

Before attempting to report this issue to the Google Looker team for possible bug, I think the first step would be to verify that this issue isn't a browser-related concern.

These steps below were my intended actions:


1. Confirm if this issue is easily reproducible
2. If it is easily reproducible, perhaps the Customer should attempt the steps in the Incognito Mode of the Google Chrome Browser. This step would help remove doubts relating to caching
3. If the issue is reproducible in the Incognito mode, then perhaps we could gather the HAR[0] files[which would include the logs of each request taken on each steps]
4. Analyzing the logs in the HAR maybe able to provide more insights to where the blockers really are!
5. If not, then perhaps it could indeed be a bug

Hello Dion,

    Could you please confirm if your product is Looker Cloud Core and if it is?
    Please confirm if the project number in Google Cloud Console: ""<800965891326>""
    is where you created your Looker instance (Google Cloud Core)?
    Otherwise, could you tell me if the product is classic Looker?

Hello Dion,

 Sorry for taking so long.

 The change was pushed to 23.12. As you can see on our release notes  ""In Looker 23.12, Looker rendering supports Chrome versions up to and including Chrome 114. Looker versions earlier than Looker 23.10 support up to Chrome version 109."".

 So whatever version they are using should be supported.

On July 27 the final version of 23.12 should be available and ready for download.

Hello Dion,

 Just a quick follow up to see if you are still experiencing the slowness.
 I am currently looking at the memory consumption in the container and see if its having any impacts on the performance. I will get back to you soon on the findings

 Also, if you could enable support access for me  ( anoopjoseph@google.com ), that would be helpful for this investigation

 Feel free to let me know if you have any questions

    Thank you !

I'm based in the UK, so the availability in your calendar is a bit inconvenient. I've book in a session for tomorrow.



I've tested the network connection using https://looker.echo.co.uk/availability endpoint and noticed some issues with my primary ISP (Three) with high rate of TCP package retransmissions.



54.220.45.90/32

34.250.249.40/32

54.154.162.83/32



Routing the same traffic over my secondary ISP (Virgin Media) seems to result in better network connectivity.



I should know by tomorrow if this resolves the actual issues I'm seeing with the web interface.

I'll be on the call tomorrow. I've seen 503s thrown for a rogue Lookerbot for Slack, usually the Heroku service is failing.

And **Jonathan Reinhard** also had this idea whcih I think is quite clever (b):


    I would ask a) does it happen to other users on the instance or only him? and b) Did he attempt to use a different network, for example by setting up a mobile hotspot on his phone and using it to connect to the looker instance.


Looking forward to our call tomorrow!

Hello Dion,

 I just got my access to the instance and I have taken a quick look at the System Activity explores. Looks good for the most part.
 However it would be a good idea to look at the Performance recommendations, if those ones mentioned in performance recommendations are used heavily by the users
 https://taboola.cloud.looker.com/dashboards/system__activity::performance_recommendations

 I have checked the instance and java memory as well and it seems to be quiet stable as well.
 However I have noticed that there is a delay in acquiring the connection and also per user query throttling as well, which tends me to believe that there might a few users who would sending a lot of queries into the database at the same time. So it would be good to know how the DB resources are keeping up when you are experiencing slow dashboards or explores to see if its hitting resource limits  or even number of active connections. If DB can hold up and handle more requests, I am wondering if we need to increase the per-user-query limits .

 I have also verified the test explore and dashboard to see if I can reproduce the issue. It looks like the first one took around 10+s to load and I believe it was waiting for the query which took around 5-8s. I have verified this from the backend and it seems to be inline with Async Query Execution.  But in the terms of the page rendering I did not see a huge delay on subsequent page loads (took around 2-3s in both cases ) where queries results are fetched from the cache.

 For next steps:
 1. Could you verify how the backend DB ( guess bigquery is the one which is mostly used ) is holding up in terms of slots available ?
 Also I saw that the connections allowed is 30. Is this something which we should consider increasing ?
 2. Same for --per-user-query-limit as well
 3. I have seen that the mem of the instance is approaching the requested memory but still within limits, and since you are planning to add more users, I can request for a proactive upsize of the instance. But please keep in mind that if DB does not hold up ( we are already seeing throttling issues ), it might actually worsen the performance.

 Hope this helps.
 Feel free to let me know your thoughts on the same

    Thank you !

I was able to make the experience better by routing our Looker instance IPs through another ISP:



54.220.45.90

34.250.249.40

54.154.162.83



The ELB however doesn't have static IPs so that have changed and the issue has regressed again as I can't route network traffic based on DNS records:



52.214.156.109

34.248.209.144

52.48.185.115



Running a simple stress test with siege [1] and these errors are very quick to reproduce.



I'm curious if there has been a change in the ELB TLS version or ciphers that could cause this issue with unreliable network connections?

Or could there be some kind of IPS/WAF in place on AWS that would be rejecting my traffic?

I didn't see you on the call, so have left it now.



I'm seeing some anomalies when testing the SSL/TLS configuration. These are probably causing the connection to drop intermittently, as my system fails to connect to the host.

Agreed, the issue seems to be between my end device and the AWS ELB and specific to network/infrastructure level issues and configuration.



I can see our Looker instance (looker.echo.co.uk) offers me only HTTP/1.1 connection.



The HTTP/2 connections used on the Looker CDN have not been affected. I would assume HTTP/2 to be more reliable than HTTP/1.1.

I would have a new question on looker, i'm playing with time fields and it seems there is a slight issue when using the `date_month` and also timezone conversion.

As a reminder with use looker in conjunction with Snowflake.



I can see the following SQL getting generated:



    (
      CONVERT_TIMEZONE(
        'CET',
        'UTC',
        CAST(
          TO_CHAR(
            DATE_TRUNC(
              'month',
              CONVERT_TIMEZONE(
                'UTC',
                'CET',
                CAST(dim_date.""DATE""  AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
              )
            ),
          'YYYY-MM'
          )
        AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ
        )
      )
    )

The issue that the following SQL does not work.

Indeed the part with the `TO_CHAR` (which is linked to date_month) will typically return `2023-06` for instance, and `CAST('2023-06' AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ)` does not work in Snowflake;



I found a workaround by removing the timezone conversion, but that then limit use cases.

I was wondering if you knew that bug and how to fix that ?



For information i see this happen with dimensions defined as such in lookml :

      dimension_group: start {
        type: time
        description: ""Date of start of the subscription""
        datatype: timestamp
        sql: ${TABLE}.""DATE_START"" ;;
      }

In snowflake the DATE_START is a TIMESTAMP_NTZ column.



Hoping this is something we can fix,

Hello Ken,

 Greetings..!!

 Hope this email finds you well.

 Apologies about delay in getting resolution for this issue. We understand that how crucial is this feature for your business. Please be note that, Looker Engg is actively working to provide the solution for this issue.
 We do understand that, it is taking longer than expected, this is due to integration with multiple components such as Sheets API and it's related components. This integration adds little bit complexity for the solution.

 I appreciate your help so far in providing required details, which my colleagues already shared with Looker Engg for better understanding on the problem pattern.

 From the case history, I do see that a cron job was setup to retry failed schedule. However, just trying to understand about alternate option such as **scheduling same report via email to customers. **I would request you to try this option until we get resolution for Gdrive issue, this would ensure report is delivered via email.

 Also, I kindly request you to add my email npalugula@google.com to support access for collecting logs of any failed schedules.

 I will be available anytime for any quick call. Please provide your available time to quickly connect and evaluate option of scheduling deliveries via email.

 Appreciate your support and patience, while Looker Engg working on this issue.

Encountering this issue when working with dates (subscription dates) and trying to match them to a date dimension table ( to get new users per month and churners per month while using the same time dimension typically).

Maybe something that is specific with snowflake and looker indeed,

Do you need more detail ?
Or a SQL query to see ?

Thanks in avance for your help !

Hello Ken and Team,

 I am Vijaya from Looker support and I was notified of this ticket during the EMEA timezone. I am going over the history of the ticket and catching up on the investigation so far.

 I see that there is an ask for a call with the support agent.

 Could you give me your timezone and availability for today and tomorrow, so that I can check with the agent on the appropriate timezone?

 Regards,

Vijaya

Also found again my initial issue !
When querying it seems to behave correctly.
However when building an aggregate table, then for some reason there is an issue :


In cafeyn model you will find an aggregate called `rollup_base_development`

You will also find the dim_subscription and dim_date views where dimensions are defined.
It seems weirdly to be working when in a query, but not when using it with the aggregate table.
If I add convert_tz:no to the concerned dimensions (dim_date.date, start and end in dim_sub) then the problem fixes,

Have a good day,

Good to hear that we have progress on the instance upgrade.



Here's the HAR file for the YoY analysis of 7 days worth of data.

It took 4.49s on BigQuery, but takes 30s+ on Looker.



Please keep us posted on when the instance upgrade has completed.

Hello Dion,
 Hope you are doing well!

 - Is the git repo hosted in Looker? or in your own GitHub?
 - Just to double check (in case it is in your own repo), does the customer added the key to GitHub and gave it write access?
 - Furthermore (in case it is in your own repo), are any of the new users able to enter the repo url but adding **_/settings/keys_** at the end of it?:
  Like this (_https://github.com/[repo_name]/settings/keys)_
 The last is just to verify that the users have the proper permissions.

Yes, I have read the release notes and I'm thrilled to see that Looker has accepted the bug and implemented a fix for this issue. I want to express my gratitude to you for following up with the Looker team throughout the process. I have tested version 23.10 which is the first version that addressed the Chromium issue on our development environments. It seems to be working fine so far.

Hello Ken,

 We're currently coordinating internally to allocate an engineering resource for a quick call to go over the issue of the Action Hub component with you, thank you for your patience while dealing with any inconvenience caused by this issue we'll reach out once we're able to schedule a quick call.

 In the meantime I'd like to suggest a workaround of using email as a delivery method if it seems GDrive Action deliveries are not succeeding.

 Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

 Sincerely,

    Alejandro S, TSE

Hi Dion, hope everything is going alright!

 I'm Victor from Looker Support and I'll be helping you with this!
 I see that we have some anomalies with the SSL/TSL Config, Is there any additional information you could share with us?

- Which version of Looker are we Working with?
- When was the first time we encountered this issue?
- How is this affecting your business?
- Can you help us by giving us the time frames for the moment the connection dropped?
 I'll be Waiting for your answers!

Hello Dion,

 Please note that your instance is upsized now with an additional node.
 I have verified the infrastructure metrics and everything looks healthy and within limits.

 Also, I have done additional verification on the dashboard below.
 1. Har file from the ticket:
      It seems the most of the time was spend on the query execution and fetching the results. As you have observed query execution just took a little more than 4s. But fetching the results from DB to Looker cache took around 28s. And that seems to be the reason why the loading of explore was slow.

 2. Test on the explore shared below:
      I have run the same test on the explore below. And the results were pretty much the same as above on the first run ( around 30s where most of the time spent on fetching results from DB). I have re-run the query and this time the results were fetched from the cache and page was loaded in less than 5s ( the time spend on content download ). Again tried with a `Clear cache and Refresh`  and pretty the same results ( 30+s ) to load due to fetching results from the DB.

 Could you please let me if this is the same you are seeing as well?
 Are we using a very large dataset. Is it having better response time if the dataset is small ?
 I just did a quick check and when i tried to fetch only 100 rows, it finished under 7s

 Hope this helps !

 Thank you

I'm really struggling with why a derived table has stopped working in our looker instance. I've created a really simple derived table (called testing_derived on the new_deals_data branch, and even that isn't returning any results). I'm sure it's a really simple mistake that I'm making, but we don't have any in-house looker experts that I can bounce ideas off. I'd love if we were able to jump on a call to troubleshoot or something?

Would you please confirm these questions:


    - Is the git repo hosted in Looker? or in your own GitHub?- Just to double check (in case it is in your own repo), does the customer added the key to GitHub and gave it write access?- Furthermore (in case it is in your own repo), are any of the new users able to enter the repo url but adding /settings/keys at the end of it?: Like this (https://github.com/[repo_name]/settings/keys)The last is just to verify that the users have the proper permissions.

Hello Matthew,

 Sorry to hear that. Would the security team be alright with scheduling to a different secure location such as SFTP as a workaround?

 We're currently syncing with the engineering team and you account team to set up a call and go over the failing component, thank you for your patience in the meantime.

Would you be willing to downgrade the priority to P2 as, since we're syncing internally with your account team,  we don't believe the case currently needs around the sun coverage. Please let me know.

 Also reach out if you have any questions in the meantime

Best,

    Alejandro S, TSE

The repo is hosted on github.com. It’s configured using a single account, using a deploy key. This deploy key has the correct access in gituhb since the setup is working the majority users.



In any case, the affected users have the correct permissions set up in github.com, but since we’re connecting using a single gihub.com account I don’t think that’s relevant.

Hello Dion,
 Hope you are doing well!

 Thanks for confirming!
 Maybe we are dealing with a case of corrupted git branches, could you verify if the customer is able to Reset Git Connection inside the Looker project as a last resource to see if this fixes the issue?

 Here is a community post that explains what happens under the hood when we hit this button: https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Technical-Tips-Tricks/What-happens-under-the-hood-when-you-hit-quot-reset-connection/ta-p/586049

Furthermore, just to verify, the instance hostname is **_autotrader, _**right?

Kind Regards,
 Mauro Alejandro

I'm Victor from Looker Support and I'll be helping you with this!
 I see that we have some anomalies with the SSL/TSL Config, Is there any additional information you could share with us?

- Which version of Looker are we Working with?
- When was the first time we encountered this issue?
- How is this affecting your business?
- Can you help us by giving us the time frames for the moment the connection dropped?

I'll be Waiting for your answers!

 The specialist detected that several deploy keys were affected by a permission change.
 He has updated the permissions of the `data_platform` project's private key.

 - Furthermore, could you please verify if the customer is having troubles with other projects?

I apologize for your experience with the Looker Service.

I do not see any report on the GCP Status page showing services are down, which is why I am seeking further assistance with the Google support Engineers. I have opened a Highest priority ticket with the GCP team on this matter.

I hope to get back to you as soon as I gather more information or insights on this matter.

Thank you for your patience and understanding

It's definitely a bug - and it's quite niche. TLDR, closing the frozen tab actually unfreezes all other open looker tabs stuck in loading.



Essentially when you try to create custom group on a dimension, looker generates a query through the grouping modal to get a down list of grouping options. Normally this is fine - but when you try to do it on a field within a view that has a parameter (view level filter) applied to it, this query within the modal seems to take forever, and looker gets stuck in loading. I'll report it to Looker - but it's def onne for the looker nerds...

Recursion Pharma is currently using Looker Studio Pro and are looking to evaluate the full version of Looker Standard.

They are wanting a session to review Looker, primarily Embed, Looker Modeler, and any upcoming integrations that might be planned. They’d also love a review of the Looker roadmap so they have an idea on new features coming up.

Can I get someone who I can work with to have this education session with the customer? No meeting has been scheduled yet but will be scheduled soon after getting someone assigned to help. Thanks!

request came from
Kwaku Danso
kwaku.danso@sevenrooms.com- please add to ticket

We are reaching out to discuss an issue we are encountering and to explore whether you might have any suggestions.

We have the following setup:
We have two Looker instances (internal and external) running on separate domains: https://sevenrooms.looker.com and https://sevenroomspbl.looker.com.
We maintain a single Git repository used by both instances. Consequently, when we merge into the master branch, a webhook deploys the latest changes to both instances.
There are two Looker models (sevenrooms-internal.model.lkml and sevenrooms-external.model.lkml) where we define our views, explores, and more.
These two instances connect to the same BigQuery tables.
Our application currently inserts every record change into a real-time table named “nightloop_ReservationActual_RealTime_v2”.
We also have another table named “nightloop_ReservationActual_RealTime_Latest” that should store only one version of each record.
At present, we have a Looker view that runs every 3 minutes, merging records from “nightloop_ReservationActual_RealTime_v2” into “nightloop_ReservationActual_RealTime_Latest”.
Upon recent deployment of this merge solution, we observed that both our internal and external instances execute the merge query. We aim to restrict the view’s execution solely to the internal instance, thereby conserving BigQuery slot usage.

Questions:
Could you recommend a method to exclusively run the view on the internal instance?
Additionally, we noticed that although we set the sql_trigger_value to execute every 3 minutes, it occasionally operates with a 5-minute interval or more between executions. Do you have insights into this behavior?

How can I make its value dynamic and based, for example, on a predefined constant? (I tested it but was able to use only the exact value, not a constant).

Or what do you recommend to use in this case?



Thanks in advance.

Responding to a quick request from Catherine that I missed while out of office. See request below:

“May we please schedule a call, perhaps tomorrow, with Dion to walk through a few scenarios with specific examples that we’re not able to determine a solution for in Looker? Probably best on a call to show what we’re meaning. I’d love tomorrow as one of the key players could be out for leave at any moment and I’d love that person there as well”

Will also be walking through our support/ticketing system tomorrow with Cat to make sure she has access to our tooling going forward

TrustRadius has just given access for Looker to the majority of their company as viewer users and would like to leverage us to do a Looker 101 style training, similar to the one we did for HUVRdata in the past. Details on request and call context:

Expecting 40-50 people
Would like to share the recording with others post-session
All kinds of roles in attendance, majority unfamiliar/non-technical
Most users will only have Viewer access

Topics they’d like to include:

Organization/layout of Looker and how to edit it to suit various team needs. For instance, how can they make use of folders and boards or favorites to help save and organize the content that matters most to them in Looker
How to download and schedule content to send regularly from dashboards
Any best practices and tips for using Looker to get the most out of it, especially as a Viewer

Scheduled for August 24th from 2:00 - 3:00 PM CDT

Ask: Are we able to screen share with a TrustRadius user to show their team a walkthrough with the TR environment?

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Cecilia, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you are getting an ""User missing permission to send to specified destination."" error.

Have you checked if there has been any changes on the Looker settings and the S3 permissions?

I would suggest to:


- **Check the permissions settings in Looker:** Make sure that the user group in question still has the necessary permissions to send data to S3. You can do this by going to the Admin panel in Looker and checking the permissions for the user group. You can see on this post [1] the error you are having might be due to some changes on the permissions of the user group.


- **Check the S3 bucket permissions**: Make sure that the S3 bucket you are trying to send data to is still accessible and that the permissions have not changed.

[1] https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Technical-Tips-Tricks/What-happens-to-a-schedule-of-a-user-after-the-permission-send/ta-p/584471

Thanks for your prompt response.



The permission setting in Looker for the user group did not change.



Re: the permission on S3 side: it is a bucket of our customer and we can reasonably assume that did not change. If it did the resend wouldn’t have worked right away as this was middle of night time for the customer.

For the start of July, we updated this CSAT script with new questions, hence the column headings are now different.



When filtering on June only, we used to be able to see the old data with the old script headings in the data dump, and subsequently new data with the new headings when filtering on July onwards.



However, a week ago, we noticed that when filtering on June data, we could see the old data, but under the new script column headings. This creates an issue when trying to download the data from Looker due to the fact the new script is a lot shorter, hence some of the old data will not show as the old script had a lot more questions.



We do not understand why this change has happened, but once checking with other members of the team, they are also unable to see the old script headings with old data.



I have attached two images, one showing July data correctly under the new headings, and one showing when we try to filter on June only.



Please could you advise us on how to get back to being able to see the old data with the old headings?

Recently a teammate of ours pointed out that she was having trouble adding dashboards we have in some folders in Looker to her favorites.



Upon further investigation, it seems we can favorite a standard dashboard but not one built with LookML directly. At least that is how it is working in our Looker account.



According to this Looker documentation we should be able to favorite dashboards from folders as well, but we aren't able to do so: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/finding-content#marking_content_as_a_favorite



Here is the view we see in one of our shared folders with a bunch of dashboards listed. This is the view for my account, I am a Developer role and I have the same experience both when I'm in development mode and when I'm not. This is also happening for Viewer roles. I think there should be a heart icon to the right of each dashboard name, right?



 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/5Ctnq4e3r0pQcy8WFlaw9x3pq/?name=pkajdroo.png)


Any guidance you have on how to make sure our team can favorite dashboards would be helpful.

If I use the runQuery api provided by Looker and pass in the format to be xlsx, how should I handle taking the response string and opening it into an xlsx document? I don't think the response string is base64 and using a new Blob option is not working either. Is there any documentation I can follow here?

So these files show mojibake encoding which is usually the result of mismatched writing systems. My colleague **Gurkomal Rao** suggested the following and I am inclined to agree with him. Please confirm you are using Looker API 4.0.

 Hello Cecilia,

Your Case 46459761 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Looker send-to-s3 permission glitch

Case Comment :

Hello,

Here you have the answers to your questions:

1. See attachment.
2. Yes
3. 16th August 2023, retriggering the export worked right away, this seemed like a glitch as we’re positive that the user group’s permission to send to s3 were not changed. We need to deliver some scheduled to clients by a specific time in a day, in the context such cases can lead to processing delays and causing further issues.

4. Nope, only one embed user who has no access to alter/adjust user permissions.

I hope we can make progress on this soon.

Regards,

Please review your case and take any actions as requested. If you have any questions or require immediate assistance, please reply to this email to contact Google Cloud Support.

Hello Cecilia,

 Thanks for providing all the information!

 I have checked the logs and could see this error in a scheduled report. Could you kindly provide me with the Schedule Job ID from the details button on the Schedule history page to check with the specific id?

 Would it be possible to provide me with the user id and the mail id of the individual experiencing this error?

Hello Cecilia,

 Apologies, for the delayed response as I was OOO .

 Thanks for sharing the details!

 I'm checking with the logs, if you could provide these details that would help us to dig the issue deeper.

 1) Please confirm, if there are any other embed users who received this schedule report successfully? If yes, share the ""user id"".
 2) Also can i get the screenshot of the schedule configuration page?
 3) As a test can you schedule the report using the ""test now"" or ""send now"" option and confirm if all the users are receiving it?

Please feel free to reply to this email with your answers, we’ll be happy to help you!

Hello Cecilia,

 Hope you are doing well!

 This behavior is observed for an embed user with a scheduled Look report and re-triggering it with the send test option works.

 I understand that, user permissions have not changed but we are experiencing a permission related error. So, when the scheduled report for the embed user fails, please check and confirm if the user has permission ""`send_to_s3""` ?


1.

Can you confirm the embedding techniques you are using for embedding the users. Is it Public embedding or private embedding or SSO embedding?

2.

If you are using SSO embed are you doing it using API explorer or using the UI?  You can refer to this article

 Adding more context for troubleshooting further, the first step to proceed is to get the SSO embed URL. Can you share the embed URL.
 Permissions, like everything else about embed users, are determined by the SSO Embed URL, you can use this article. So whatever manual changes you are making to the user in the UI will be overridden the next time the user authenticates through the embed URL.

We are trying to solve a problem that we think would greatly help improve the user experience of our customers when they use our embedded dashboards in our vendor portal. As a reminder, we are using the iframe embed option if that helps.



We want both dashboards we have embedded to load automatically upon page load so the user has somewhere to start in terms of viewing data without having to take any initial actions with filters and clicking the load button.

It seems like there is an auto_run setting we can use for this potentially: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-lookml-dashboard#auto_run



The problem we are having is we have three different scenarios of how we need this to work:

1. Multi-product dashboard
2. For users with multiple products we want the dashboard to load data for all products from the Product filter option upon page load
3. Single-product dashboard
4. For users with multiple products, we want the dashboard to load data for one of their products, we are not picky which one gets pre-selected but it would be great if we did have a way to choose which one
5. For users with one product, we want the dashboard to load data for that one product





I'm attaching the LookML for each dashboard as well if that helps.

Not Kaylin but I think I can help. I think our two scenarios are:

Multi-product dashboard

- For users with multiple products we want the dashboard to load data for all products from the Product filter option upon page load

Single-product dashboard

- For users with multiple products, we want the dashboard to load data for one of their products. We are not picky which one gets pre-selected but it would be great if we did have a way to choose which one
- For users with one product, we want the dashboard to load data for that one product
To add a little more context here, for the multi-product dashboard scenario, we have a situation where our filtering is implemented in such a way that the filter has fewer suggestions than the underlying data on the dashboard has values for the filtered dimension. What would be ideal is if there was a setting where we could load the dashboard with all the suggestions in the filter selected, which is not the same as loading the dashboard with no filter for this particular case.

For the single product dashboard, what we are looking for is a dynamic default value, so that if we had Customer A, we would have product A1 as the default value, but if we had Customer B, we would have product B1 as the default filter. We can't really have a universal default because we have different customers with different products. We haven't been able to find a way to do this. Again, if Customer A has multiple products, we are not picky about getting A1 vs. A5, but we would like to be able to get an A#.

Here, you can specify the x and y axis values marking the boundaries of each quadrant. The issue is that when a custom axis value falls outside of the range of values in the data, this boundary value is ignored, and instead the mean for the remaining data is used.

This is problematic and misleading, as in our reporting we have built measures to allow a user to isolate the items in a single quadrant. To apply this functionality, the boundaries are set to specific values (in our case 100). While the items are correctly isolated (our filter measure works as intended), the custom x and y values of 100 fall outside of the min/max range of values in the data, and so default to the mean of the remaining data. I have attached images of this issue to hopefully further clarify.

Our expected behaviour is that when a user filters to only include values in the bottom left quadrant, _only_ the bottom left quadrant should render (i.e. in the examples below, the _entire_ scatterplot should have a red background). The actual behaviour is that four _new_ quadrants are generated within the value boundaries of the bottom left quadrant.

Please can this be updated to follow the expected behaviour.

Please excuse me for a late reply, I had a vacation.



It seems there is no solution for this task and **week_start_day** model parameter works only with the exact weekday values and doesn't support any dynamic conditions.



I tested some combinations with user attributes like:

_week_start_day: {_user_attributes['week_start_day']}_

_week_start_day: _user_attributes['week_start_day']_

but all of them returned an error.

Hello Cecilia,

 I have heard back from my team, to provide the following information to understand the issue better and narrow down:

 Please confirm, if this user(12316) created the schedule?
 Does the other embed user were the schedule is working as expected have an email address assigned?
 Is this private or sso embed?
 Can you also confirm, if this schedule is working fine now for all the users after re-triggering but we want to know the cause or reason for this behavior? If no, please ask the embed user  to test ""send now"" to check if it works?

 Please feel free to reply to this email with your answers, we’ll be happy to help you!

As I said today, we have some solutions in place today to make sure our vendors see only their data, but this is inefficient because it loads much more data than is needed and then filters at the end in the outermost WHERE statement. I believe (and correct me if I am wrong) that your solutions from today will suffer from the same issues. I understand that using PDTs will somewhat solve our problem not by getting rid of the inefficiency, but by making it a lot less noticeable. But there are other situations where we would like a dynamic default not only for performance reasons but also for user experience reasons.

The core of the idea is to set a user attribute equal to a list of products (for vendors with only one product, this list will be just the product). I believe the appropriate format would be something like: ""Product1"",""Product2"",""Product3"". We then have the default value on the dashboard filters set to something like.

default_value: ""{{ _user_attributes['default_product_names']}}""



We would keep these up to date on our end. I'm not quite clear if we would use the Looker API or something else because of how we handle embedded reports. But that is the crux of the idea. Do you see anything immediately wrong with this idea or any pitfalls we may encounter?

Encountering an issue in on Looker in a view where we use a sum.

Due to a join it seems, looker instead of doing a sum tries a sum distinct.

Except in the sum distinct it then adds the primary key to what we want to sum, and hence the results are completely modified.



Would you be able to join for a call to help as i think this will be way easier to explain?

However i send a screenshot of the issue to explain what is a problem.



Is there a way to prevent the primary key from being summed in ?

We were thinking derived table, but do you think of something else that would be less effort to maintain in the end ?

We haven't found an easy solution to this on our own so we are reaching out for your guidance: is it possible to customize which of these time duration options are shown to the user for a date filter on a report? For example, we want to keep duration options like days, weeks, months, years. But some of the options there like seconds, minutes, and hours are unnecessary for our reporting purposes.



I will also attach the LookML of this dashboard in the screenshot example to this ticket if that helps.

Hello Cecilia,


Hello Cecilia,

 Just checking if you have received the previous email.

 I have heard back from my team, to provide the following information to understand the issue better and narrow down:

 1) Please confirm, if this user(12316) created the schedule?
 2) Does the other embed user where the schedule is working as expected have an email address assigned?
 3) Is this private or sso embed?
 4) Can you also confirm, if this schedule is working fine now for all the users after re-triggering but we want to know the cause or reason for this behavior? If no, please ask the embed user  to test ""send now"" to check if it works?

 Please feel free to reply to this email with your answers, we’ll be happy to help you!

No I have not heard anything from the AM quite yet.



The larger use-case that we are looking to solve for is that we have third-party agents that need access to a dashboard containing their data (and only their data). This will require a substantial number of additional licenses (~150 as a starting point, with a high likelihood for more). I was curious if it was possible to set up a lower level license at a lower cost that would remove permissions like forecasts and explores.



Open to any suggestions you might have.



Thanks,

I'll keep this thread open, but my colleague is making some important transformations to get a primary key.
He was pretty surprised to see his primary_key was not unique. I guess always double check the basics indeed,

I shall keep you informed of the progress and if we keep the same issue,

We would like to support a discussion about embedded Looker solution with Moneygram.

The larger use-case that we are looking to solve for is that we have third-party agents that need access to a dashboard containing their data (and only their data). This would require a substantial number of additional licenses (~150 as a starting point, with a high likelihood for more). So interested in embedded looker.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Tyler, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand you're having an issue with the line chart's drill feature in some of your Looker dashboards.  They open up correctly upon drilling-down into them, but when you go to download them, the screen goes blank.  I saw the video - thank you.

I'm going to reach out to one of my colleagues with vast Looker experience for some assistance with this.

In the meantime, can you please try clearing your browser's cache/cookies - and/or try a different browser?  Sometimes clearing out cache and/or cookies from a browser (or compatibility issues between browsers) can cause this type of problem in general.

Please let me know if that helps resolve this issue; in the meantime I'll be working in parallel to get  assistance from a resident in-house Looker expert in case it doesn't.

Sincerely,

https://developers.looker.com/api/advanced-usage/looker-api-oauth


# Registering an OAuth Client Application
Every OAuth client application that attempts to authenticate into the Looker API using OAuth must first be registered with the Looker instance before Looker will authorize access. To register an OAuth client application:


1. Open the API Explorer on your Looker instance. The default URL used to reach your Looker instance’s API Explorer is `https://<instance_name>:<port>/api-docs/index.html`. The default port for Looker instances hosted on GCP, Microsoft Azure, and instances hosted on AWS that were created on or after 07/07/2020 is `443`. The default port for Looker instances hosted on AWS that were created before 07/07/2020 is `19999`.

2. At the top of the page, enter your API client ID and client secret and click **Log In**. If you do not have an API client ID and client secret, your Looker admin can generate them on the **Users** page in Looker's Admin menu. See the Users documentation page for more information.

3. Use the drop-down menu in the upper right of the page to choose the **4.0 - experimental** version of the API, and click **Reload**.

4. Use the `register_oauth_client_app()` API endpoint to register your OAuth client application with Looker. You can enter the parameters in the API Explorer and click the **Try it out!** button to register the OAuth client application, or use the `register_oauth_client_app()` API endpoint programmatically. The required `register_oauth_client_app()` parameters are:


  - `client_guid`: A globally unique ID for the application
  - `redirect_uri`: The URI where the application will receive an OAuth redirect that includes an authorization code
  - `display_name`: The name of the application that is displayed to users of the application
  - `description`: A description of the application that is displayed to users on a disclosure and confirmation page when a user first logs in from the application

We have a problem with our Git connection for our bluecode_dwh looker project.



The problem occurred while we added user attributes for the GitHub user and GitHub token. We removed those attributes since the connection did not work properly for one of our colleagues.



Now the problem got even worse, when I tried to open the project in the development tap I could not access the project anymore, even with my admin rights.



We tried to recreate the user attributes but did not work. My guess is that we have troubles with our git connection, but we can't do reconnect since the settings are in the development tab.



Any idea how to fix the problem?

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Renato, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you are having trouble with your git connection in Looker.

Have you tried to sync it manually, by hitting the project's deployment hook?

This article goes over the steps: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/git-options#using_a_deploy_webhook_to_pull_from_a_remote_git_repository

To break it down, you want to open a new tab, paste the following URL but replace the variable `<instance_url>` with your Looker instance host URL, likely something like bluecode.cloud.looker.com (if that's your instance URL):


    <instance_url>/webhooks/projects/<project name>/deploy


Please let me know if that works for you. If not, I see that you're in EU, so I'll transfer this to a colleague in EU to schedule a meeting according to your timezone.

Sincerely,

Thank you for your patience.  The Looker expert I enlisted to help troubleshoot this was out for his daughter's wedding since Friday, so I was just able to speak with him about this today.

He'd like to see this in action - could we set up a quick call so that we can see this happen over a screenshare?  Please choose any available time this week (or next, if that's better for you) from my calendar here:

https://calendar.app.google/T5KkFfn1Fps6yg1z6

Also, are you able to send over a few screenshots of the JS console that you view through your browser?

- This is located in Google Chrome by going to the hamburger menu in the upper right, selecting `More Tools` and then selecting `Developer Tools`  From there, click on the `Console` tab within the Develop area that opens up.

Of particular interest are any errors generated in the Console area when you run this report and perform those drill-down steps.  We'd just like to see if any relevant information is there that might help get us on the right track.

Lastly, can you please confirm whether you're using iFrames as opposed to the Looker Embed SDK?

If you can send over any screenshoots from the JS console in the meantime, and confirm which ??? you're using, that would be a very helpful start.  I look forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Jared,

Apologies for the delayed response!

As i mentioned in the last follow up we are not able to reproduce the behavior internally and it appears to be an isolated issue due to its single user and one-time occurrence. Without a reproduction, it would be difficult for us to identify and troubleshoot this kind of behavior. So, if a customer experiences the same behavior again please reopen the ticket then we investigate the issue further and find the root cause of it.

No problem. If you're talking about Dion he did let me know he'd be out for a bit to celebrate his daughter's wedding. :)



Yes, happy to provide a screenshot of the console.

2. I clicked a line chart and selected a drill down option to open up the modal to see the different view

3. I clicked ""download"" in that modal and chose CSV

Looks like a 400 and a 404 error within the console when these download issues occur.  I've passed on your screenshots, and that you're using iFrames to Dion as well.

Dion and I will be at the meeting you scheduled for Monday at 10:30am PDT/12:30pm CDT.

Look forward to seeing you then!

Thank you,

Thank you for coming back to me.

I tried to book an appointment with for next week, but your calendar was booked out/ blocked. Do you have a free appointment as of next week Wednesday?



Also the topic of my request changed slightly. Other than customising the map, we are looking to built a custom theme for our looker app. Would be great if you could take that into account.



Have a good weekend

Before I get back, I wanted to make I do some research and make sure there is no known issues from Google cloud, I looked at Incident logs and nothing is mentioned that could be causing this.

Can you please confirm when was this working last ?
Can you please rule out browser as culprit by trying this with different browser and also in private mode.
Confirm if Looker DD extension is installed and has appropriate permissions
Could you also please confirm LDD app Version?
Last do you see any error?

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Birger, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you need to change your Looker connection to connect to a different project and have run into permissions issues.

Your Looker connection uses a service account. To resolve your permissions issues you will need to ensure that service account has been granted the appropriate permissions on the other project.

E.g connecting to another project just means that your BQ jobs will be billed against that project (and, if applicable, use the reservation you've assigned that project to). For that, your service account would need the Job User role [1] (or an equivalent custom role) on that project.

However, to actually access datasets in that project (irrespective of where you're connecting to and running the job), your service account will need permissions to query those datasets (e.g. via the Data Reader role [2])

If you are querying datasets from multiple projects (or from a different project than the one you're connecting to), also make sure you're using fully qualified names (i.e. including the project name) for all tables, views etc that you are referencing in your queries.

Would you mind elaborating what you are trying to achieve, what you've already tried and what results you encountered that were unexpected to you (and why)?

Keep in mind we don't have access to you Looker instance. So you will need to share with us how you've configured your connection.

However, you can grant us read-only permissions on the relevant projects (e.g. the one containing the service accounts and the one you want to connect to where you are getting the permissions issues) so that we can review permissions there.

Regards,
Birger

Here’s a list of issues we’re facing

- Slow and lagging platform in general. It takes a few seconds to change the code in LookML, edit the visualization, navigate through explore, or even a small adjustment like increasing the width of a column
- Clean up duplicate dimensions/measures or ‘recent’ unused dimensions/measures
- Improve the query performance. E.g. utilize aggregation awareness and how to effectively integrate the BigQuery’s partitioned fields, clustered fields in Looker

Extra:

- If you have any clients you think are super organized and polished Looker platform we would love to see some examples as a guideline/best practice.
- Or if you can help us connect with other clients that would be nice too!

Hoping you can help. I am looking to see if I can edit schedules in Looker. I thought I was able to do this previously (thought might be making that up) but I can't seem to be able to do this - either as an Admin or if I sudo. It only gives the option to reassign or delete.

We have two ongoing production issues with Looker for a few days already that are impacting the generation of reports in our platform this impacts our customers directly as this is one of the main features we provide.



1. For said reports, we generate temporary looks and try to render them via the API. The rendering of these looks never finishes. We have contacted Looker's support and they restarted our Looker instance and it improved a little, but most of the looks still never finish rendering. I want to emphasize that this is an issue we already had, and Looker's support was able to resolve it in the previous time. (see screenshot from the API where the status is ""enqueued_for_render"" and never changes to ""done"")
2. During the generation of these looks, there are some weird queries that Looker runs on our Snowflake instance. Looks like there are the same number of these weird queries as there are filters in these Looks, and the ""where"" statement in these queries is weird and very general. According to our analysis, these queries do not include the hardcoded filters we have on the looks, so they result in huge table scans, taking forever and blocking the generation of our reports. See the query at the bottom of this message. You can see that it was generated by Looker. We always filter by ""realm_id"" and by ""unique_snapshot_id"", but in this query, they are absent from the ""where"" clause.



These two issues have been impacting our production environment for two days and our production is impacted by this. We are communicating with Looker's support but they don't seem to be able to resolve these issues.

I've seen similar issues with running CTEs on Snowflake before so I'm going to start there. Do you have the case number for the issue that was resolved previously. I will open a case wtih Google and include that case number so we have as much history as possible (please include any other relevant case numbers if possible).

Thank you for the log file. I found some CTE specific errors but not all CTE queries so not definitive.


1. Would you please go to the `/admin/next/queries` page and copy and paste errors related to the API calls? My working theory is this a known bug with how Snowflake applies transforms to data prior to filtering (not following the SQL. standard).
2. Also, please run the failed SQL in SQL Runner and let me know if it returns expected results or errors out and return the error.
3. Confirm your Looker version (top right on the `/admin` page).

Once I receive the errors I will escalate a P1 with Google to see if they are already working on the issue and/or they have a workaround.

I will be online until 0800AM GMT+3. If I don't hear back from your team by then I will hand this off to our Looker SME in Dublin.

Thank you.

Sorry for the late reply.

Some points that I think were misunderstood. These queries are not supposed to run at all. They are not related to the data we show in the look, and they take a very long time and time out because they don't have the filters that are specified in the look.

There are no expected results for these queries - they are just redundant.

We expect only one query to run for each look.

The Looker version is 23.16.63.

Any update? I would like to remind you that this impacts our production environment so needs to be resolved ASAP.

I would also like to emphasize that the two issues I mentioned don't seem to be related. Looks whose queries finished running are stuck in a queue as well.

Reaching out due to an error on a specific query.

This is a query that is really heavy on the DB but we like the flexbility we get (cohorted churn in time).

So we want to use aggregate tables to treat main cases.



However we encounter two issues:

- The Get LookML option does not work for the aggregate tables we get a red error
- The aggregates tables we create by hand are not used by the query, mentioning fields not used/not exactly matched by the aggregate table; However our eyes do not see what changes.



I'd like to see if you can understand why the aggregate tables are not used, and potentially share best practices on cohorted churn in time.

Looker Support is going to continue it's investigation into the (probable) bug and see how we sytematically disable query suggestions in the LookML generated SQL. In the interim, you can disable filter suggestions at the view or field level:

https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/changing-filter-suggestions

I know any change with to your production environment should be executed judiciously and in Dev environment first so, please let me know if you want to have another call to review the results. I will continue to work with Chris and Jiro at Looker to reach a resolution on the potential bug.

I will lower the priority of this issue from Urgent to High but keep the Google Support case a P1.

Thank you.

We confirmed that labs feature `Reduce Filter Queries` is responsible for creating the suggestion queries and, subsequently, hitting the timeout on the database. If we disable that lab feature it should stop the offending behavior. Please let me know your thoughts.

1. Using **Scheduler Plans** page in the Admin panel. There you can reassign yourself as the owner for existing schedules. After reassignment you can then edit as needed and save changes, and if needed, reassign back to the original user.
2. Using the ability to **Sudo** as other users on your Looker instance. Once you Sudo as a given user, you can edit their schedules as needed, save changes and you're all set.
3. Using the update_scheduled_plan() API Endpoint.

Thanks for your time the other day.



Just to check on the first two options there as these still don’t work for me as discussed?



The only way (outside of the scheduler api that I haven’t used) – is to go in to the individual dashboards and do it that way?



1. If I reassign the schedule, I only get the option to delete it and not edit it

![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/wLPnQQdwKZ742Z7hPjmUbKslK/?name=image004.png)



1. If I sudo as the person, the same thing happens – I only see the edit button.

![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/07vmGGMRPtfu7ieZjs3xEDuRT/?name=image005.png)



I think you said you were going to check the release notes – did you find anything in there and should I be doing something different to get those options to work?



Thanks

We were able to implement the workaround you suggested with the `suggestable` property and seems like it resolved the issue.

We do still need a permanent solution as for some fields we are unable to use that property because we do want autocomplete on them when using the dashboards not via the API.

We would like to add another group to this embed shared group but cannot see an option to do so.



Can you please assist?

We are available for whatever you need to get this issue resolved.

Regarding the queue you have no control over, this bug impacts our ability to continue using Looker. As I mentioned before, the current workaround is good enough for now, but will not be good enough when we have to use the same fields in the Looks we render via the API and ones we allow filtering by in the dashboards.

Not solving this bug or having a permanent workaround will force us to start checking other alternatives as this is very critical for us.

Our domain is dashboards.harness.io.

Thank you for this information.



Can you clarify what these scheduler events are? Are these dashboard delivery schedules? Or are these other events, such as PDT rebuilds?



If this is the case, what can we do from an infra standpoint to scale for future use cases? Our last production instances were due to similar issues, and the resolution was to up-size our instance. We need our instance to scale with these spikes in the future. Why was the previous up-size not resilient enough for this spike?

Scheduler events include any schduled look or dashboard or any anything with trigger (like datagroups and pdts).

But I don't know if this is an exhausting list so I asked for clarification but I do not know the relationship between the scheduler and the outage is causal.

I specificatlly asked the Looker Dev Ops team to investigate/explain this.

Thank you.

    I shared the repeated behavior with DevOps team and they made the next change to the instance during the maintenance window in order to mitigate future restarts:Adding a Scheduler Looker Node ( these are nodes that are dedicated to jobs, and don't block the UI. They are useful when certain jobs are causing Looker to choke.)Please feel free to let me know if the behavior somehow appears again.

To resolve, please retry your schedule or wait until the next scheduled job.""



Based on some searching, I found this Looker support forum thread that seems to indicate there may be too many/too large reports running but I wanted to see if there's a way to confirm that or if there are other Looker capacity issues/outages happening currently that might be causing this?



The reports that are failing aren't new reports and we haven't seen significant data volume increases, so I'm not sure it's really what's happening here. We're seeing it on 8am, 9am, and 10am central time runs this morning with seemingly no consistency between file extensions or delivery types on the ones that are failing.



We're going to try and stagger the runs for next week but I'd love some assistance confirming that this is the real root cause and not something else we need to be looking into.



I've attached a screenshot of the mix of some of the failed and successful runs. Let me know what you need from me to dig deeper!

Thanks for providing access. What I can see in the metrics is not that the application is down, but it is having high latency when uptime checks are coming from Virginia. However, Oregon and Iowa need to show the issue.

I want to know where the application is hosted and check the application logs and metrics to see if the application has a problem. It could mean that the traffic from Virginia has increased, and the traffic from Virginia is being processed just from some instances with too many connections. For this reason, the latency has become higher, but it could also be network latency. It could also be any issues with the network equipment in the internet path between the uptime check in Virginia and your application. I have checked the GCP dashboard, and I could not find any networking issues.

I can see that the latency is back to normal now, maybe because there is not much traffic now. Therefore, I will move the case to one of my colleagues in the US, so that if you face the issue again, we can troubleshoot the issue while the latency is happening.

Global Load Balancer is named sp-collector-url-map and i.northbeam.io resolves to 34.120.178.247 which is in use by Global Forwarding Rule sp-collector-forwarding-rule.

Its target proxy is sp-collector-https-proxy and the backend service is sp-collector-backend-service

The backend is sp-collector with instance group members only in us-central1.

The backend does appear healthy during this period. I do see a single 502 occur but nothing more than that.
https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=SEARCH%2528%22%60i.northbeam.io%60%22%2529%0A-httpRequest.status%3D200%0Aseverity%3DWARNING%0A-httpRequest.status%3D404;cursorTimestamp=2023-11-15T22:44:22.467744Z;startTime=2023-11-15T13:48:44.543Z;endTime=2023-11-16T03:03:47.197Z?project=nb-snowplow-prod

The latency we're seeing on the external uptime check does appear to be a transit network latency issue and not a problem with your infrastructure, GLB, or backend.

We could raise a GCP support case to see if their monitoring systems show the latency on their infrastructure. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. As a of now, everything looks solid.

    Thank you for contacting Google Cloud Platform Support. I understand you have observed an increase in latency for the uptime checks and would like to better understand the case of the issue.I have researched internally for any issues during the mentioned time frame (11-15-2023 8:48 AM - 10:03 PM ET) but I haven’t found any known issues. I have inspected the shared link with the following syntax [1] and have observed the single 502 error. I have further inspected the logs with respect to the server IP “10.128.0.163” that responded to the request. I would like to mention that, currently the VM Instance associated with that IP address doesn’t exist in the project.During the same timeframe, I have observed the gce-instance logs for the specific IP address using the following syntax [2] and I have observed that there are debian renewal logs, this could be the cause of the observed behavior.I hope the above information addresses your concerns. If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out by replying to this message. I will be happy to assist you.

I'm wondering if there is a way to get dimension / measure metadata for a Look using the API. I have a hacky way of getting some by running an inline query with an invalid date. The query json_bi format response contains this metadata for each dimension / measure:

    {
        ""sql"": """",
        ""view"": """",
        ""dimension_group"": null,
        ""category"": ""dimension"",
        ""field_group_label"": """",
        ""name"": """",
        ""type"": ""string"",
        ""view_label"": """",
        ""label"": """",
        ""field_group_variant"": """",
        ""hidden"": false,
        ""description"": null
    }

But additionally it would be nice to have these fields so our UI can identify suggestable fields and the format of the data that comes back. (i.e we just get decimal values rather %, mph etc.)

    suggestable
    value_format

I have tried using this endpoint but receive a 404 probably due to permissions

    GET/lookml_models/{lookml_model_name}/explores/{explore_name}

Is there some way of getting this or does it simply require the explore level permissions?

My colleague **Joe Dabbert** came up with this gem:


    import jsonimport sysfrom typing import cast, Dict, List, Unionimport looker_sdkfrom looker_sdk import models, errorsdk = looker_sdk.init40(""looker.ini"")look_id = 36response = sdk.look(look_id=""36"")query = response.queryfor i in query.fields: print(i)


This should get you the fields from a given look_id.

Sorry there's some confusion. I can get those fields from the look using the look ID which is fine.

What I want to do is get the metadata for each of the looks fields.



So for each field I want to access the underlying metadata as it is defined in the explore / view

Thanks for joining the call earlier.
I'd like to summarize what we talked about in the Google Meet meeting:


- You screen-shared your dashboard and showed me how you generated the PDF.
- You used ""letter"" format and found the image doesn't render in the PDF file.
- After we checked the tile, we found it downloads the image [1] from the Internet when rendering.
- I believe the issue is related to the render engine failing to download the image.
- I found a link [2] where someone suggested using base64 encoded string to render image.

Could you try the code I shared in my previous reply and let me know if this solves the issue?

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

 - Does it work fine if download the whole dashboard manually and download the tile with issues only?
 - Please test opening the dashboard and select three dot menu > Schedule delivery option > Test Now button in order to send the report manually

 Thanks in advance.

If you didn't see Google's reply just came back and I wasn't sure how many tiles were on there, but do remember it being practically all of them that were longer. On top of that, I wasn't sure if you had tried to do it manually for each tile or not. I put their response below[1].

Could you reply back to them or us on here to pass along?

Also I have passed this ticket onto our Looker SME here, Dion. He will be taking lead on this for you.

- Number of records in the tiles with issues?

- Does it work fine if download the whole dashboard manually and download the tile with issues only?

Yes, I can download this tile separately, but once they are on the same dashboard it breaks and I am not able to render the PDF. This is confusing because it is only 7 tiles and way under the Looker recommended limit.



- Please test opening the dashboard and select three dot menu > Schedule delivery option > Test Now button in order to send the report manually

Yes, I am getting this error when I send a scheduled report, download manually, or use the API to run the render task.

Hello Sayle,

 Thanks for answering the questions, actually I forgot an important one: which Chromuim version is installed on your end?

 In order to review this issue with my teammates, please share a screenshot of the pdf file with the cut off tiles and a screenshot of the dashboard where we can see those tiles rendered correctly.

 Thank you,

Hi Sayle,

 Could you schedule the call for this Friday 8 between 11:30 am and 2:30 pm EST? If it doesn't work for the customer let us know the time slots for the next week.

 While checking on previous tickets with issues for PDF errors, reinstalling the chromium solved the issue. It sounds like a possible issue with Chromium installation causes this kind of issues. Chromium is the rendering software we use to render any reports as PDFs, PNGs, etc. I'd recommend checking this link and either install chromium or re-install install it to get the latest version, then testing out those schedules.

Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Kate, and I was assigned to your case.

I understand that you are seeing multiple derived tables (PDTs) in Looker when you believe there should be only one serving both models? Are these SQL derived or native (LookML) derived?

PDTs can be shared by multiple models so your analysis that there ""should"" only be one table serving both models is correct. As you are seeing duplicates it is likely that one of the following is happening:

- The datagroup parameters that you have used to persist the PDT are defined differently across your 2 models
- The models use a different connection within the model file
- One of your models has been defined as case sensitive, while the other one isn't. Case sensitivity can affect how a where clause is parsed changing the underlying SQL
- Looker generates a new PDT when it identifies changes in the table's SQL or its triggering parameters, which could be happening due to model-specific settings
- Using the `include: *.view` syntax across all of the models can also cause duplicates. It's recommended to create folders that hold the required views, and then reference the folders directly rather than using the match all wildcard: `include: ""/folder_name/*.view.lkml""`
I'd recommend double checking the above to make sure you aren't hitting any of the known reasons for this duplication and if you still cannot see the problem let's arrange a call so we can go through all possible settings.


Please let me know if this answers your questions, and if you need help, I will be happy to assist you.

Sincerely,

Nice to meet you,



Regarding to your questions it is native(LookML) derived table.



I’ve reviewed the possible causes that you have sent me  for duplicated derived tables bellow is the summary:



1)  datagroup_trigger is defined on lookml of derived table , and both put are triggers and created on this trigger.



view: developers_dt_daily_developers_projects_views {



    derived_table: {



      distribution_style: even

      indexes: [""record_tstamp_date"",""customer_name"",""property_id""]

**      datagroup_trigger: madlan_looker_update**



      explore_source: pre_daily_property_view {



        column: property_id { field: dwh_fact_property_views.property_id }

        column: customer_id { field: dwh_dim_customers.customer_id }

        column: customer_bussiness_id { field: dwh_dim_customers.customer_bussiness_id }

        column: customer_name { field: dwh_dim_customers.customer_name }

        column: customer_type { field: dwh_dim_customers.customer_type }

        column: customer_type_id { field: dwh_dim_customers.customer_type_id }

        column: is_paying_customer { field: dwh_dim_customers.is_paying_customer }

        column: portfolio_manager { field: dwh_dim_customers.portfolio_manager }

        column: number_of_visitors { field: dwh_fact_property_views.number_of_visitors }

        column: number_of_property_views { field: dwh_fact_property_views.number_of_property_views }

        column: record_tstamp_date { field: dwh_fact_property_views.record_tstamp_date }

        derived_column: dt_pk { sql: property_id||'-'|| record_tstamp_date ;;}



      }

    }



2) The models has the same connection defined in both models :



connection: ""redshift""



3) Both models have no defined parameter of case_sensitive at all.



4) Both models are in production and has no any changes in sql , both derived table are triggered for creation by datagroup that is defined on derived table level as mentioned in first paragraph.

 Also what do you mean by “model-specific settings” can you give more details ?



5) Both models have no include:*.view syntax .



What further investigation you suggest?



Thank you



Freddie

We identified the behavior explicitly that indicates a possible root cause to the issue, specifically that the two 'identical' derived tables that are created at the same the time are in fact not identical and have different row counts. We verified the primary_key is indeed unique and non-null but there is still a loss of referential integrity. You are investigating further on your own since the cascading effects of that datagroup_trigger might affect generate 40 minutes of creating derived tables. I think we identified the neighborhood of the root cause, just have to find the specific address. I will be available for the rest of your afternoon for another screen-share. Please, let me know what you find. /dion

I’ve analyzed the sql of creating derived tables and find that one of the derived table has additional condition that is filtering a lot of data,



That is the reason why two derived tables are created. From this point I understand what should be done.

We wanted to get on a technical call with Joe and Dion to go over some questions about our Looker licenses and which technical use cases would require separate user licenses. This is specifically about our potential future use case involving API reporting inside our application, not our current Looker platform and license renewal for 2024.



I may have misunderstood, but on the recent call we had with Elaina and the Google team, they mentioned that anyone making use of Looker's semantic layer would require a user license, which we had some questions about.



1. What are the boundaries of when someone needs a Looker license? All three of the below examples make use of Looker's semantic layer, but it doesn't seem that any of them should require additional user licenses outside of the Dina internal users and service accounts who would be creating and configuring the reports and visualizations returning the data.



- Scheduled Looker reports to external e-mail addresses (for making operational reporting available to our customers) make use of the semantic layer, but those users don't require any additional user licensing, right?



- If we have a dedicated application service account licensed as a Standard user that has an API key assigned. Using that API key, Dina's application allows Dina users to access data from our Looker API, with filters set by the Dina application to apply Dina's RLS logic to the query. Excluding the service account that's assigned the API key, this usage wouldn't require any additional user licensing , right?



- If we exposed a Look with ""Public Access"" enabled, for example a collection of useful healthcare marketing information that might convince leads to reach out to our sales team, this usage wouldn't require any additional use licensing, right?



We'd love to get on a call to better understand what we can and can't do with our existing licenses to make sure we're handling things correctly, thanks!",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,8.9,212.7,0,2.4,142,"$9,027",1,1

 About having a call for screen share of the issue, could you send the time slots for Dec Thu 14 or Fri 15? It would be very useful to have a better picture of this behavior.

Just as a final note, we found that `google-cloud-dataproc` adds the `ttl` field in version 5.4.0 [1] so anything below 5.3.0 [2] should always produce the error. Unfortunately, `apache-airflow-providers-google==8.8.0` uses a very old version of the Dataproc client library because of dependencies that rely on an old version of protobuf. Upgrading to 5.4.0 should lead to conflicts similar to [3].

Using new versions is generally recommended, but, it might not always be feasible within certain environments since it could cause other sections of your code to fail. For this reason, a temporary solution can be to leverage the `KubernetesPodOperator` [4] to create a customized pod. By attaching a custom image (with the Dataproc Client library version >=5.4.0 installed),  you can have the pod execute a script containing Dataproc client library [5] code, instead of using Airflow operators.

Hello Sayle,

Thanks for try updating Chromium.

About having a call for screen share of the issue, could you send the time slots for Dec Thu 14 or Fri 15? It would be very useful to have a better picture of this behavior.

You and I suspect the migrating from 23.18 to 23.20 (a supported version) would be a logical next step given this new feature in 23.20:


    Quick Layout for dashboard editors has been added behind the dashboard_layout_accelerator feature flag, which is available to customers in preview. Users can now move dashboard tiles to the left or the right side and also resize them to standard sizes. Fill out the Looker Dashboard Layout Accelerator Preview Sign Up form to sign up for the preview.


It is not uncommon to fix small, related bug with new features. Now that I've seen the extent of the cropping and we replicated the error in Firefox this has the hallmarks of bug so I wil research similar issues in the usual places. Please let me know what you think.

 Hello Sayle,

Your Case 48315398 for Google Cloud Platform has been updated.

Case Subject: Saving Report as PDF is Cutting Off Tiles

Case Comment :

I think this may be fixed by upgrading the Looker instance from 23.18 to 23.20 (a supported version) because some of the changes listed in the Looker Release notes are relevant to Dashboard visualizations and PDFs. This is not a browser issue.

Please review your case and take any actions as requested. If you have any questions or require immediate assistance, please reply to this email to contact Google Cloud Support.

Looker might have configuration settings that determine whether artifacts and configurations are deleted when an action server is removed so I am combing through any new doicumenation that might be relevant. Also, if other components or processes depend on the artifacts or configurations associated with the action server, Looker may retain them to avoid breaking those dependencies. Please confirm your Looker version, if you're self hosted or Looker hosted, and that you're on GCP. Version conflicts can aldo produce idiosyncratic behavior this this. Can you meet Monday?

Customer has usually done extensive research/troubleshooting before raising a case. Cases have visibility of senior leadership.

If requested to raise a case with Google support, please do not push back. Customer has made us aware of examples where the resolution was delayed due to us being resistant of passing on cases without a solid reason.

This customer has been struggling for many years with issues in their GKE zonal clusters. They are reluctant to migrate to regional clusters as the effort for them would be huge and the benefits are not so clear. Be sure not to recommend them to migrate to regional GKE clusters without a good reason even if Google Cloud support does recommend it.",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,77.5,1860.7,1,1019,61140.8,"$251,234",1,1

Based on the information you've provided, it seems like you're trying to set up an SFTP connection to a remote server using AWS Transfer Family. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. Open the AWS Transfer Family console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/transfer/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/transfer/).
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Connectors**, then choose **Create connector**.
3. Choose **SFTP** for the connector type to create an SFTP connector, and then choose **Next**.
4. In the **Connector configuration** section, provide the following information:
   - For the **URL**, enter the URL for the remote SFTP server. In your case, it would be `sftp://omnitailfeeds.hostedftp.com:22`.
   - For the **Access role**, choose the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to use. This role should have read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the `StartFileTransfer` request.
5. In the **SFTP Configuration** section, provide the following information:
   - For **Connector credentials**, from the dropdown list, choose the name of a secret in AWS Secrets Manager that contains the SFTP user's private key or password. You must create a secret and store it in a specific manner. For details, see [Store an existing secret for use with an SFTP connector](#sftp-connector-secret-procedure).
   - **Trusted host keys** – Paste in the public portion of the host key that is used to authenticate the user to the external server, or choose **Add trusted host key** to add an additional key.
6. After you have confirmed all of your settings, choose **Create connector** to create the SFTP connector.

Please note that the IAM role you use should have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket where your CSV files are stored. Also, the secret you create in AWS Secrets Manager should contain the username and password for the SFTP server.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, a specialist will be assigned to help with this request.

For more information, you can refer to the AWS documentation on [Creating SFTP connectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-connector.html).

Keywords for further search: AWS Transfer Family, SFTP connector, AWS Secrets Manager, IAM role, StartFileTransfer

Additional questions for troubleshooting: 
- What is the exact error message you're receiving when trying to set up the connection via Looker?
- Have you verified the username and password for the SFTP server?
- Does the IAM role have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and the Secrets Manager?
- Have you stored the SFTP server credentials correctly in AWS Secrets Manager?",0,0,,0,1,0.00%,3.3,79.5,0,0.1,5.6,"$100,296",1,1

I can ask our DevOps engineer if we can update, but could you please confirm the reason that we need to upgrade? We are currently on version 23.18.40, this version is listed publicly on Lookers website as being officially supported from October 2023 - February 2024. We are currently on a version that is supported for 2 more months. DoIt and Google should be able to offer us support on this version. If they can not, I would like to know why?

I suspect there is a bug fix in this 23.20 feature:


    Quick Layout for dashboard editors has been added behind the dashboard_layout_accelerator feature flag, which is available to customers in preview. Users can now move dashboard tiles to the left or the right side and also resize them to standard sizes. Fill out the Looker Dashboard Layout Accelerator Preview Sign Up form to sign up for the preview.


It is not uncommon to fix small, related bug with new features. Now that I've seen the extent of the cropping and we replicated the error in Firefox this has the hallmarks of bug. Unfortunately, i have not found reported bugs exactly like yours but a fair number of similar PDF cropping issues, just not across all rendered PDFs.

Thank you.

Josie, Elena, and I are going to meet and make sure we're all on the same page. As for increasing the horsepower on the monthly APIs, Looker just needs to increase your resource allocation. You're probably not on a cluster at the moment and but they would. mostly move your instance to a hefty cluster. This probably comes with a license  change and Elena should be able to answer that (I'll ask when I meet with her). But the mechanics are pretty pedestrian.

Thanks!

I'd like to have brief meeting with you and your AM **Chris Avery** so that I know exactly what your team needs to know. I'm a nuts and bolts engineer, not a sales engineer. so my demo will be for developers, Dev Ops, and analysts by default.  What dates would you like to have this demo?

Any data in the System Activity explores are limited in terms of showing data that anyone with the System Activity Explore permission can see so the API key (client ID and a client secret) won't be exposed.
But reporting which explores and fields are being used is fair game and are accessible for the enhanced System Activity explore which I believe you should have.

I found a similar case where users were able to download the report in the CHROMIUM 98 version rather than when using the latest versions.

As of now, Looker rendering supports Chrome versions up to and including Chrome 114. Looker versions earlier than Looker 23.10 support up to Chrome version 109. We can check for this information in the release notes: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/release-notes

Let me know if by downgrading Chromium to 98 version works fine.

Regards,
Carlos

Seems like indeed this query cannot be run in SQL runner, since there is no access to the internal Looker database. You need to recreate the report in the following way.



Steps to replicate:

1. Navigate to Looker hope page
2. Click Explore
3. Within explores, view the sub category of System Activity
4. At the bottom of System Activity (for me at least) there is an explore called User
5. In the User explore, select the following dimensions from three different views:

- User:
- Created Date -> Date
- Email
- ID
- Is Disabled (yes/no)
- Name
- User Facts:
- Last Attempted UI Login Date -> Date (this is the dimension causing the discrepancy I believe)
- UI Sessions -> Last Attempted UI Login Credential Type
- User Permissions -> Is Looker Employee
- User Role:
- Role List

Added some images as well for more clarity

Good news:


    Thanks for reaching out to Looker support. I see that you found a discrepancy for the last login information for the user anoopjoseph@google.com between what is reported in System Activity and what is reported in the Admin - Users panel. Since this user is a Looker employee, they most likely logged in through support access , and it looks like these logins are not counted in the reporting on the Admin - Users panel. In general I would recommend using System Activity as the source of truth. I won't be able to share the full System Activity LookML model, but I will look for the specific SQL query that we run against the internal database for populating the ""Never Logged In"" value in the Admin - Users panel and send it to you so that you can compare the queries directly.Best,Chris


and...


    It looks like the new Admin - Users panel runs the following API call to populate the list of users and their information.Request from 127.0.0.1, GET /api/4.0/users/search, {""embed_user"":""false"",""fields"":""id,email,first_name,last_name,role_ids,group_ids,credentials_email,credentials_google,credentials_saml,credentials_oidc,credentials_api,credentials_api3,credentials_ldap,credentials_embed,display_name,is_disabled,is_iam_admin,can"",""page"":""1"",""per_page"":""25"",""sorts"":""first_name asc,last_name asc""}Each credential type listed in the API call, such as credentials_email, has its own corresponding internal db table, so we run separate queries against each table like this:SELECT * FROM `credentials_email` WHERE (`credentials_email`.`user_id` IN ([list of user ids]))The results from these queries include the last login date for the user, which is in a last_login_at field in each credentials table. However, the credentials for users who log in via support auth access are stored in the credentials_looker_openid table, and credentials_looker_openid is not one of the credential types requested in the query params of the API call. Therefore, we do not retrieve the last login date for support auth access logins.It seems like we should be including every credentials table in the API call we run for this page so that we are accurately reporting the last login date for every listed user, so I'll let the engineering team know about this issue. In the meantime, as I mentioned previously, I would recommend using System Activity to verify the last login dates for all users. You may also be able to get more information on support access logins from the Support Access Login dashboard: https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-general-support-access#support_access_auditLet me know if there is any other information that would be helpful.Best,ChrisGoogle Cloud Support


Thank you.

This afternoon I would like to discuss a few approaches to the problem. A colleague in New York from [Spectacles.dev](https://www.spectacles.dev/) made these presentations about a year ago and I think they lay the ground for a useful, albeit non-trivial solution. If you have the time all of his Looker webinars are really quite helpful.

How To Fix Your LookML Project Structure

The first three recommendations are:


1. Keep your model files unchanged from their Create View from Table auto-generation by storing them separately .
2. Centralize edits of view  files using Refinements.
3. Store Explores in their own dedicated files.

Think of refactoring your single massive LookML project like replacing your fence a few boards at a time.

The second part of this strategy involves extensive use of Groups (instead of roles) at the permission level and [access_grant.

Robust Access Control And Permission Management

Assuming groups are already inherited at the database, we can assert they will still be useful in Looker. At the model level we can use `access_grant` for granular  requirements (in lieu of OAuth). Here are the Best Practices for Groups.)(https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/best-practices/how-to-manage-users-with-groups)

Additionally, there are two tools that I know will make this more economical in execution:

1. looker-open-source The Admin Power Pack is a tool for Looker administrators to accomplish certain management tasks more efficiently. It is a Looker add-on application built using the Looker extension framework. Currently it offers utilities for extended functionality in two main areas: schedules and users.

2. Looker Deployer (aka 'ldeploy') is a command line tool to help move Looker objects across instances. This includes Content (Looks, Dashboards, entire Spaces, etc.), Boards and Connections, and Authentication.

I'm seeking a way to utilise templated filters or liquid parameters for multi-string input to an IN statement of an SQL query.



The use case is to run to have a query that calculates the number of bookings on online accommodation sites using scrape data, namely a metric called Future Occupancy.



I would like to aggregate by multiple Local Government Areas (lga_name_1) and to do this I require a WHERE statement in the query feeding the view in the derived table below where an IN statement lists the lga_name_1's.



I'm currently achieving with just a where statement and singular strings, i.e 'Noosa Shire', however I would like to convert the query to use



    WHERE lga_name_1 IN (""multiple strings"", ""..."")



How can I implement a solution such that I can feed multiple strings into a derived table SQL query from an explore using liquid parameters/templated filters?



See the view below (excuse the huge derived table query it is mostly irrelevant for this question besides the WHERE statement for the lga_name_1 column) for the current single string implementation notably where the query writes

But I think we can  replacedthe {% parameter LGA_filter %} directly in the IN statement with the liquid parameter {% parameter LGA_filter %}, which allows you to pass multiple values as a comma-separated string.

When using this parameter, you can input multiple values separated by commas, like this: 'Noosa Shire', 'Another LGA', 'Yet Another LGA'. The liquid parameter will dynamically replace {% parameter LGA_filter %} with the provided values, constructing a proper IN statement for your query. Please try this out!/dion

Thanks for the response.



I also thought of this, though we have the filter facing the user and I don't want them to have to put in quotes ' ' , or commas , into the filter as it will get confusing.

Here is the input and output I'm getting right now with the implementation you mentioned:

    lga_name_1 IN ({{ _filters['future_occupancy_by_LGA.LGA_filter'] | sql_quote }})



Output:

    WHERE
    pricing_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) AND CURRENT_DATE() AND lga_name_1 IN ('""Adelaide City Council,Brisbane City""')



It does however work for individual strings.

Output:

    WHERE

Now what the limitation here is, is that I would like the suggests to be injected into the IN statement. Currently I can only click on one suggestion and I have to type the rest which isn't optimal.



I.e. this on the Looker UI (which is possible when the filter is a dimension and not a parameter)

For context, the primary reason for this injection via the IN statement is due to the query being far too large to run or even make a PDT given the resources we want to provide to this query in terms of compute.



The idea was that we filter on the lga_name_1 and have it run much faster rather than have it all aggregated at once and use via a PDT, which only takes a couple seconds.



But, given the limitations of user input we arrived at the problem at the start of this ticket.



Since then I have tried a few things, and arrived at this being the view now:

    }

Now it is messy given the group by for lga_name_1 and it being a selected column is still in the query, though because we are using the where statement in each subquery it still runs as fast (despite the where statement occurring again the final query at the bottom) while providing the following functionalities:



1. Allow for the UI clicking functionality and no typing.
2. Allow the following referencing of the dimension to work.



I would be more than glad if there is a cleaner way to do this, but till your response I'll rock with this.



See the screenshot below for how this actually ended up looking on the explore screen too.

- The customer might need to use IN ( {{LGA_filter._parameter_value | sql_quote}}) instead of the traditional {% parameter LGA_filter %}.  This gives the same function of the parameter but just the value [1]

We have a question about row limit in Looker. From the documentation here it seems like the row limit of 5000 in any query results / visualisations created in a look / dash is a hard limit? I understand that in terms of downloading query results there are permissions like download_without_limit that allow users to download more than 5000 rows, but our use case here is slightly different. A user sometimes would have more than 5000 entities relevant to them, and they would want to have a side by side comparison of their performances at a portfolio level i.e. ideally we would like to be able to have a single look created for that purpose to cover everything in a single table for each user, but the row limit is currently stopping us from doing that. So wondering if there is any way we could adjust the row limit or is it really a hard limit.



Many thanks!

You are absolutely correct and I verified it's in the paid contract sent to Looker. If you are using a Looker (Google Cloud core) instance, you will see the Private Label page only if you are using the Embed edition of Looker (Google Cloud core). The only cause of not seeing the feature enabled is that Looker has not enabled it by omission. I can make the request but I know they will tell me that one of the Technical Contacts on the Looker /admin page will have to make the request even if it's in black in white on a contract. I apologize for this on behalf of Looker but I know they'll say the request has to come from a known Technical Contact. Once you make the request I can escalate it immediately.

Please let me know if you want to get on a screen share today.

Your SQL is not structured logically and Looke does not recomplile SQL. Looker compiles LookML into SQL. Looker will take your SQL from the `sql:` parameter and plug it into the compiled SQL. That's why you won't see any errors until Looker tries to run the SQL against the database.

Let's look at your SQL:

    WHEN ${is_atf_phone} = 'yes'  THEN ('ATF Phone' and 'ATF Tablet' and 'ATF Computer' and 'All Phone') ELSE


`THEN` what?

This isn't how CASE WHEN statements work if any SQL dialect. This why I asked you to write it as an IF THEN statement. CASE WHEN and IF THEN are compiled identically by Looker and generally the same in most SQL dialects. I can not derive what you want to achieve based on your CASE WHEN and neither can Looker.

Please, try writing your CASE WHEN as an IF THEN statement.

Thank you.

My name is Dion Edge and I'm a Looker SME here at DoiT. Just for context I worked at Looker as a support engineer, including time with Looker DevOps, before Google's acquisition. VPC Network Peering is designed specifically for this use case. This method involves creating a secure, private connection between the VPC where Looker is hosted (you're Looker hosted if I remember correctly) and the VPC where your Cloud SQL instance resides:


1. Enable Private IP for Cloud SQL in the instance settings.
2. Set Up VPC Network in the GCP Console.
3. Configure VPC Peering in the GCP console.
4. Update VPC Network Rules to allow traffic between Looker and your Cloud SQL instance.
5. Configure the Database Connection in Looker to use the private IP of your Cloud SQL instance.

If you run into any connection issues, open the JS console and look for http errors and we can go from there but this is a fairly stable pattern to follow. Please let me know what you think.

We experienced an import problem following the incident on CM360 on February 22nd.

Indeed, on this specific date (and not on other days), we have a return **from CM360** of more than 90% of unknown gclids.

It appears that CM360 has lost a considerable number of floodlights tags, which we use to re-import revenue from each of our conversions. What is the procedure to follow to correct this problem and reimport the income for the day of February 22nd ?



We contact the Google Campaign Manager, and here is their answer:

Unfortunately Google Ads products including CM360 are not supported/sold by DoiT. I'm unfamiliar with that product, but I do work a lot with BigQuery so I think I can help you submit this case. Here’s how you might structure your request to BigQuery support:

**Brief Overview of the Incident:**

Start with a brief description of the problem on CM360 on February 22nd, highlighting the high percentage of unknown GCLIDs and the loss of floodlight tags, which has affected your ability to re-import revenue for your conversions.

**Objective:**

Clearly state that your objective is to re-import the conversion revenue data for February 22nd into CM360, using BigQuery as the intermediary for processing or storing this data.

**Specific Challenges:**

Outline the specific challenges you are facing, such as difficulties with matching conversion data due to the high percentage of unknown GCLIDs, or technical limitations in processing or querying data within BigQuery for re-import purposes.

**Details on Data Structure and Storage:**

Provide information on how your conversion data are structured within BigQuery, including any tables or datasets specifically used for storing CM360 data or conversion data. Mention any existing queries or processes you use for handling this data, especially if they were affected by the incident.

**Assistance Required:**

Ask for guidance on the best practices for re-importing conversion data into CM360 from BigQuery, specifically in scenarios where there is a significant loss of identifying tags or information.

Request assistance in creating or modifying BigQuery queries to accurately match and prepare conversion data for re-import, considering the loss of floodlight tags and unknown GCLIDs.

Inquire about any tools, scripts, or APIs available for facilitating the re-import process, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

**Previous Steps Taken:**

Summarize any steps you have already taken in an attempt to resolve the issue, including communication with CM360 support, any troubleshooting or data recovery efforts, and adjustments made to your data processing workflows.

**Contact Information and Availability:**

Provide your contact information and availability for a follow-up, indicating your preference for communication (email, phone, video call) and the best times to reach you.

I am happy to help you with any solution the BQ Support may provide. I hope this helps.

Thank you.

We have a dataflow job that reads in messages from PubSub and writes them into avro files, the file each is written to depends on the source of the message. This job has recently experienced a large increase in load, and with that we have seen our data freshness go from averaging around a few minutes to growing to over 10 hours.



 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ZTIkjGoFGbhDoVS4GJe0u06w0/?name=glnnjplz.png)




Our dataflow job has an hourly window when it emits files as well as a second trigger which will emit files early if they reach 1 million messages. When digging into the cause of this issue today, we saw an instance where we were collecting messages between hour 00 and 01. We emitted over 20 files early due to them containing 1 million messages, but then after we reached hour 01, nothing was emitted. A little over two hours later, we see the job start emitting ""early"" files for the 00 hour. This goes on for three hours, emitting 45 files, all of which are for the same message source. For example, we emitted ""messages_from_my_source_1_EARLY.avro"" and then five minutes later we emitted ""messages_from_my_source_2_EARLY.avro"". Only after each of the 45 files for this message source were slowly emitted did we suddenly emit all of the other files from all sources within the same second. The following pictures show exactly what I'm describing.



 ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/x0ffZMDh1KPrHn7xxgyC6Fr9W/?name=tbvwzcam.png) ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/7YJGktGpQPmQpV4yH1RfRVFJF/?name=nppotyly.png)


So it appears that something about this source held up the emitting of the files. We checked the 45 file sizes for this source and while all were around 440 MB, that is not significantly larger than the 250 MB we saw for other files. We also have other sources that will emit 8 or 9 files early because they have reached 1 million messages. While 45 in an hour is certainly bigger, we don't see why this would cause a 5 hour backup.



Do you have any insight as to what could be causing this or how we may go about investigating it?

I wanted to also share that our job has always been running fine with 40 workers. When we noticed the backlog, we increased the number of workers to 200 which is more than 4 times the normal number of workers. We have not seen much improvement with this change so I am going to lower the number of workers to 100 to reduce costs. Doesn't seem like the issue is resource related.



Another note I wanted to share was that 2-3 years ago we have seen performance issues when our NAT gateway was too small. We have since moved to using GCP Cloud NAT and haven't see any issues since. I wanted to double check with Google Support to make sure there that Cloud NAT isn't the bottleneck.

I understand that you're observing odd behavior in your Dataflow job, creating bottlenecks in your `write` queue which makes your data stale as soon as its available. DoiT is not allowed access to your environment so I need to open a case with Google Support to continue the investigation. I will stay active on this case with you, just need to get GCP engineering eyeballs on it. Please, let me know if you have any other information germane to this issue. If the data reside in GCP, they will retrieve directly, but if there's anything else like a 3rd party outside of Google that is exhibiting odd behavior it might be worth investigating. It may not be causal but indicative of something that is.

This will help speed up the investigation. There has been some criticism of direct error messaging for Dataflow so I'd like to submit those query logs as well if those `WARNING` messages are present.

I have a question about Dataflow windowing for Google Support. Looks like the EARLY panes always fire first and blocks the ON_TIME pane. We are seeing all EARLY panes get fired sequentially and when the last EARLY pane is fired then all the ON_TIME panes get fired. Is this correct? If so, this blocking behavior is causing major delays for us. We would love to better understand how this is supposed to work.

Each pane represents a partial view of the window's data as it accumulates. However I think it is more accurate to say early panes do not ""block"" on-time panes in the sense of preventing them from executing.

However, the on-time pane will only fire once the watermark indicates that the system has received all expected data for the window. If the watermark's advancement is delayed (due to factors that I cannot yet identify), this can make it seem like there's a delay before the on-time pane is processed. It might be due to how watermarks are managed or the configuration of your triggers. Some combination producing idiosyncratic behavior, maybe the mark algorithm not accurately predicting data arrival.

I did finally get an update from Google Support:


    If your pipeline has stages with high system latency [1] or logs indicating stuck transforms [2], the pipeline might have performance issues that could raise data freshness. You can follow these guidelines [3] for troubleshooting to investigate further. For us to look into the issue, kindly share the job ID involved.[1] https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf#system_latency_streaming[2] https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/common-errors#processing-stuck[3] https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/troubleshoot-slow-jobs


I couldn't find the job_id in the screenshots and we don't have access to your console. Would you, please provide it when you have a chance? I will stay on this until we reach a resolution.

If there are any topics you specifically want me to address, please let me know and I will prepare appropriately.

    I inspected `2024-03-06_10_41_49-8401492328801569112` and could find several warnings and error messages.This warning message [1] indicates that the job is getting stuck and this could the reason for the increase in data freshness/backlog.In this specific case, Dataflow spent more time in the step called `write-high-volume-messages-to-gcs/WriteFiles/WriteShardedBundlesToTempFiles/WriteShardsIntoTempFiles`.In the case, there are many possible reasons as to why the step would get stuck. If there is a delay or the pipeline is stuck then [1] is noticed. This delay builds up and compounds the issue of system latency. This behavior has two possible causes:+ Your DoFn code is slow, or waiting for some slow external operation to complete.+ Your DoFn code might be stuck, deadlocked, or abnormally slow to finish processing.Consider using Cloud Profiler [2] or other tool to investigate the performance of your code. For more information on [1], kindly refer [3].

So Google is doing away with 3rd party cookies in 2024 and we currently embed Looker Dashboards in our product via cookies. So I am researching our options which seem to be

1. use a custom domain
2. use cookieless embedding



While trying to follow the instructions on https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/looker-core-custom-domain I cannot locate Looker in our GCP projects.



I assume this is because we had Looker before we had GCP, but am unsure. Can you help me find out if I can manage Looker via GCP and if so, what Project it is under? I looked through all the ones I have permissions on and could not locate it.



Furthermore, if you have experience on which path is simpler to take, I would apreciate some guidance.

And I concur that I can't see your Looker instance in your console across two projects so you're probably right that Looker just wasn't recorded and it's on its own resouce. I think we have to adhere to the contract for me to support you. I can start that process for you i just need your instance url and a technical contact (assuming its you).

As for how you should operate in the post cookie world, it dpends on your traffic, query load, schdules. I'm happy to peofmr the analysis but I think I should pull in your Account Manager the post cookie world since how you want to proceed may affect your licensing costs. Hopefully in a good way for you. Do you want to meet tomorrow or next week?

I set up sometime tomorrow to chat real quick.



I believe the no 3rd party cookies issue might be solved on our side b/c we are using a custom domain. (looker.sheerid.com)



But I am still interested in understanding how we can manage Looker and GCP and that set up.

1. You want to join two or more tables that are in exactly two databases
2. Both databases are BigQuery
3. The two BQ Dbs are located in the following projects
  - `business-intelligence-316418`
  - `showpass-1370`

Also, I will make sure associating your Looker instance with `business-intelligence-316418` is a transparent process to your users and I will give your team a `{{ headsup }}` before anyone starts flipping switches. If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact us.
Thank you.

1. I believe it was only 2 datasets in 2 different projects, but it might be 3 in one project joined with 1 in a second project.
2. Both are in BigQuery.
3. NO.

  1. We want to join table(s) in Sheerid Business Intelligence
  2. 1 table in Sheerid Production



I can ask for exact datasets and tables if you need them to help figure this out.

He did have this question:

One thing that I _would_ like to be able to do is see the query logs / explain plan for queries that are executed from looker



Would you be able to tell us how to do that?  And would we be able to do that once it was under a GCP Project.





Oh and to clarify, we would like to move the Looker management under the Sheerid Business Intelligence  project.

I only have access to the two projects below  so I will request access accordingly and start the process to move your Looker instance to the right project.

Thanks for providing the system activity log, we are now able to find the log there as well :-)



What is still unclear after researching this some more: Which exact option was changed on the Embed page that broke this? i.e. what is the name in the GUI? That's the only information I cannot find from the activity event log, and would be immensely important to add to our post-mortem! We want to be 110% sure to fully understand this on our side, so it will never happen again :-)

After some more research, we found the option to be ""Embed SSO Authentication"". Setting this to ""Disabled"" removes all the embed options at the bottom (including the validator, embed secret, ...) and we were able to reproduce the same error we saw yesterday (log in prompt for signed embed link).



According to logs, the update_embed_config event happened at 2024-03-13 16:24 CET.

According to logs, the most recent license refresh was at 2024-03-13 16:46 CET, 22 minutes later, presumably when we went to the license page for troubleshooting!



With this, we could definitively rule out that a license change caused this problem. We don't remember consciously disabling Embed SSO Authentication, but the logs don't lie and are tied to my admin login :-) In conclusion, we were able to fully reproduce and fix the events from yesterday, which gives us a lot of confidence.



Thanks again for your help and the super fast turnaround yesterday! We learned a lot and really appreciate you jumping in.

I built this query in the System Activity Events explore as a better reference:

https://sellandpick.cloud.looker.com/explore/system__activity/event?toggle=fil,vis&qid=BLoRPKwOIwJU1nSsJskbss you just have to remove my name from the filter.

I think the first step is identifying `user 2`. As for the feature, `update_embed_config` has the following attributes:

- `old_value`: previous auth enabled setting
- `new_value`: new auth enabled setting
- `action`: whether auth was enabled or disabled
- `domain_whitelist_count`: count of allowlist domains

So, if disabled, will remove Ember Secret and the URI Validator but that caveat is explained way over here. The effects are implied but not explicit, at least not in the same place in the docs. It's not intuitive to me at least.  And if an Admin makes the change, at least when I did on my instance, there are no warnings.

You could set up Looker Actions to fire when certain Admin event categories are triggered which would provide some oversight if there are other Admins with overwatch. This was educational for me. I did not know that select embed features could be removed like this. This is a FR I think to invoke a warning dialog.
