    "Comment by Andrew Dundee: User \"andrew.dundee@mirada-medical.com\" created a new chat called \"If I have a resource of typ...\": at 2024-06-25 3:24 PM. Chat ID: TtTQYGM35v1kBZ6gMf0C.   **andrew.dundee:**  Time created: 2024-06-25 3:24 PM  If I have a resource of type AWS::ApiGateway::Account in my cloudformation template and I deploy multiple stacks from that template on the same account and region, is that likely to be problematic?  * * *  **Ava:**  Time created: 2024-06-25 3:24 PM  Yes, deploying multiple stacks from a CloudFormation template that includes a resource of type `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` in the same AWS account and region can be problematic. The `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource is a singleton resource, meaning there can only be one such resource per AWS account per region. This resource represents the API Gateway account settings for the entire AWS account in that region.  When you try to deploy multiple stacks that each include an `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource, CloudFormation will encounter a conflict because it cannot create multiple instances of this singleton resource. This will likely result in deployment failures for the subsequent stacks after the first one.  ### Potential Issues:  1. **Deployment Conflicts**: Only one stack can successfully create the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource. Subsequent attempts to create this resource in other stacks will fail. 2. **Stack Updates**: If you need to update the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` settings, you will have to ensure that the updates are made in the stack that originally created the resource. Updates in other stacks will not be possible. 3. **Resource Management**: Managing a singleton resource across multiple stacks can lead to confusion and potential misconfigurations.  ### Recommendations:  - **Single Stack Management**: Ensure that the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource is defined in a single, dedicated stack. This stack can be referenced by other stacks if needed. - **Cross-Stack References**: Use cross-stack references or export/import values to share the necessary information between stacks without duplicating the singleton resource. - **Modular Templates**: Design your CloudFormation templates in a modular way, separating singleton resources into their own templates and stacks.  ### Example:  You can create a dedicated stack for the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource and export any necessary outputs. Other stacks can then import these outputs as needed.  #### Singleton Stack Template:      Resources:       ApiGatewayAccount:         Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Account         Properties:           CloudWatchRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ApiGatewayCloudWatchRole  #### Other Stack Template:      Resources:       MyApi:         Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi         Properties:           Name: MyApi           # Reference the CloudWatchRoleArn from the singleton stack if needed  By following this approach, you can avoid conflicts and ensure smooth deployments across multiple stacks.  * * *"

    "Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: Hi    We have created a private DNS with a zone called vocls-dev.vastdata.com.    The VPC is peered with out internal networks and addresses are reachable (ex: we can ssh an host or access a service on GKE with TCP load balancer).    But when it comes to private DNS the service either to return empty answer or return the answer to go to vastdata.com even when addressed directly.    The DNS private zone + the dns policy were created with terraform using this HCL configurations      resource \"google_dns_managed_zone\" \"license-server_private_dns_zone\" {      provider = google-beta      project = var.project_id      name = var.private_dns_zone_name      dns_name = var.dns_zone      description = \"Private DNS zone\"      visibility = \"private\"      private_visibility_config {      networks {      network_url = \"projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/${var.vpc_name}\"      }      }     }      resource \"google_dns_policy\" \"allow-private-dns-ingress-policy\" {      name = \"allow-dns-ingress\"      enable_inbound_forwarding = true      enable_logging = true       networks {      network_url = \"projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/${var.vpc_name}\"      }     }    This has worked and the ip assigned is 10.83.0.9 (the network is 10.83.0.0/16).    but when I try to resolve addresses directly when connected to our VPNs or from our offices I get the following answer.      host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. 10.83.0.9     Using domain server:     Name: 10.83.0.9     Address: 10.83.0.9#53     Aliases:      Host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)  However connecting to a VM running in this subnet will resolve the address      host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. 10.83.0.9     Using domain server:     Name: 10.83.0.9     Address: 10.83.0.9#53     Aliases:      bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com has address 1.1.1.1    The firewall allows all UDP traffic when connected from VPN/Offices, also if it was a FW issue response would have simply timed out.    I have talked to out IT and they verified we are not doing any kind of packets manipulations when it comes to DNS.  It is also important to mention that we have used this configuration several times at different projects with different subsets before and it always worked.

Can you try to do a simple check, I would like to make sure that this IP address \"10.83.0.9\" is reachable from your on-prem servers, just do this command from an on-prem and/or with your VPN (please specify cases (with or without VPN) when you share results):       $ping 10.83.0.9   Please share the command output, thanks,  Best Regards,      Jean-Alain Mignon (ja.mignon@doit.com) // DoiT International (Paris) Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: this will not work as I dont think that the DNS service will answer ping as I think it does not answer to ICMP packets.  I also tried it with a working DNS service in other project and it will answer ping    So I dont think it is a valid test Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: I have tried to remove & recreate the policy and got the same result ... not the ip is 10.83.0.11 Comment by Jean-Alain Mignon: Hello Tal,  The idea behind the ping is just to confirm that you can reach this particular IP from on-prem, because this can be a reason, the DNS Service from on-prem has to reach the DNS resolver in GCP by using his IP, DNS uses IP layer over udp as you know, also now if you have change the DNS Resolver to 10.83.0.11 just make sure that you can ping this address from on on prem, this is just a basic connectivity test, if you wish I can setup a Google Video Call, please let me know,  Also to able to request a GCP private DNS host zone you need a private connectivity between on-prem and GCP, which private connectivity do you have from on-prem at the moment?

    "Comment by Jason He: Hi DoiT team - We got our invoice for April 2022 yesterday and something seemed a bit off. As apart of the new deal we signed a few months ago, we were issued a bucket of credits that seemingly we ran through in March. This specifically was the google portion of the credits per the following screenshots:     ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/TqFZ78nCFUFBVgEzdVwvnH9aW/?name=kedlybxj.png)    ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/p0lpTImFT0M2uHZ3HsOGCtt21/?name=evnlgfux.png) (Specifically, the migration credit dated March of 2022 on that 2nd screenshot).    However per the invoice we got, we seem to have been charged the **full price** and not the reduced one with the credits applied like we see in google's billing view. I've attached the invoice for your reference. Could you help us get to the bottom of this?    Thanks  Jason Comment by Dina Peisahov: Hi Jason,  Thank you for your email.  Can you please send me the screenshot from the Google console showing the credits? Once received, I will forward them to our credits team and they will be registered in our system (Google isn't informing us when a customer receives credits) and adjusted against future invoices (we can't reconcile credits against invoices that were already issued).

I generated this report to gather the data i need: https://console.doit.com/customers/h6ORt9K0vBqiJliFetCK/analytics/reports/NQl4bP4dordAyEwJ47x7  One thing that is not clear is why the Customer Reservations savings type was previously positive (cost) and is now negative (savings). Can you help me understand this?  * * *  Submission Date: 2023-09-06 Requested by: maggie.ambrose@doit-intl.com  Customer Name: phenixrts.com Customer Region: North America Customer Country: United States Cloud Provider: DoiT Console Comment by DoiT Helper: See also the discussion on Slack: Slack Thread Comment by DoiT Helper: Zenrouter () assigned the ticket to andrea@doit.com:   - not on vacation - not on holiday - available in Zenrouter - within working hours - not out of office - no focus time event - more than 1 hour left till end of the working day - matching primary platform skills [cmp/platform] Comment by Andrea De La Vega: Hello Kyle  Thank you for contacting DoiT International.

Comment by Andrea De La Vega: **Maggie Ambrose** what do you mean the \"customer reservations\" showing negative?   ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/HupNBWPynCrx5nUkM3MNWhFEN/?name=image.png) Comment by Maggie Ambrose: In the screenshot you shared, the third column has a negative value, while the two months prior were a positive value.

Comment by Maggie Ambrose: Hi Andrea is there any more information on this from product? Comment by Sven Gerhard: **Andrea De La Vega** Please follow up and provide an update to the customer. Comment by Andrea De La Vega: **Sven Gerhard** this is an internal ticket and communication is only happening between Maggie and I.  **Maggie Ambrose** I reached out to the product team again, hopefully ill have information soon.  https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/C023EL4637U/p1695063648482719 (private channel) Comment by Sven Gerhard: OH, I see that @Maggie Ambrose requested that ticket for kyle.bank@phenixrts.com, and just looked at that you had responded to it to the customer. So maybe that was a mistake. Comment by Andrea De La Vega: Hi **Maggie Ambrose** This is the information I received from the Product Manager:   > When flexsave was active, the savings were recognized in Flexsave savings. > > > > When we spun down Flexsave, there were several hours where the customer was getting the full 3-year savings recognized as their own CUDs (even though they were Flexsave CUDs)   Please let me know if this does not make sense and I will go back to him.  Thank you! Comment by Sven Gerhard: Hey Kyle, Please note that the ticket is now closed. If there are any additional requirements, please reopen the ticket or create a new one using /GetPSS and we will manage that request for you.

    "Comment by Gregor Pacnik: Hi    We are looking for some guidance/help on how to best setup limited access to one of GCS buckets from our back-office React app.    In the app there are currently only 5 users. Authentication is via firebase auth + custom claims. The idea is to be able to display images stored in GCS bucket to only people that are logged into the app and no one else (public). All users would have access to all the images so there is no need for user level permissions.    I guess we are looking for the neatest solution on how to issue individual GCS access keys per login session.    Thanks,  Gregor Comment by DoiT Helper: Zenrouter () assigned the ticket to paul.obrien@doit-intl.com:   - not on vacation - available in Zenrouter - within working hours - not out of office - no focus time event - not in a meeting and no upcoming meetings - current active tickets weight is below the threshold - reasonable frequency of ticket assignment, last assigned ticket 2h0m1s ago - more than 1 hour left till end of the working day - matching primary category skills [gcp/category/storage] - ticket country AU Comment by Paul O'Brien: Hello Gregor,  Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Paul and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that your using Firebase and GCS and would like to limit access to your GCS storage to only authenticated users.  Given you are using Firebase you could add the Bucket to Firebase storage  and then use the firebase SDK to download files as follows [1]?  Also use firebase storage security rules to allow only authenticated users to download (instead of the Google allAuthenticatedUsers setting)  This firebase storage security rule would allow all authenticated users to read from a path in the bucket      service firebase.storage { match /b/{bucket}/o { match /{allPaths=**} { allow read: if request.auth != null; } }}   Does that sound like an acceptable solution for your use case?  [1] https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files  Regards,  Paul O'Brien (paul.obrien@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Customer Reliability Engineering (Australia, UTC+10) Comment by Gregor Pacnik: Hi Paul    That sounds great, didn't even think of that.    Follow up question, how can I give firebase account permission to access the bucket? For reference, the firebase app is in the `nl-urkel` project whereas the target bucket `nl-urkel-storage` I want to grant the access to is in `neighbourlytics-dev-170803` project and cannot be moved due to being used by many services and accounts in there.    I've granted this ticket read-only access to the nl-urkel project if that helps.    Thanks.

Comment by Paul O'Brien: Hi Gregor,  Apologies for the delayed response, I was at a customer event on Friday afternoon, only just getting back to it today.  I'll need to investigate the cross project access a little more, will have an update for you later today.  Regards,  Paul O'Brien (paul.obrien@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Customer Reliability Engineering (Australia, UTC+10) Comment by Gregor Pacnik: Hi Paul    Thanks for the update. Don't stress, this is not on our critical path yet.    If Firebase is giving you grief we are happy to explore direct connection to GCS. We are using Firebase function to issue enriched claims JWT so it should be fairly easy to add extra code to provide access token for GCS. This would then in turn help us with doing a similar approach but from our .net core backend for another app with similar access requirements.

Comment by Paul O'Brien: Hi Gregor,  You could either you the process you outlined or the Firebase method which is to use Custom Claims to support issuing commands against another project.  Since you have the enriched JWT process setup I think you could do either approach, from a personal preference I think the one outlined below is more scalable and agile.

The question now is how do we go about it? I want to have expiring GCS access token (Firebase re-authenticates every 1h so an expiry of 1h makes sense) issued on login of every user, this is the part that we could really use your help with.

Comment by Sean Matthews: Hi Team,  Please refer to the internal note below with the background to this query.  Thank you kindly, Sean Matthews Comment by Mehdi Nemlaghi: Quickly looked at customer management account:   - customer is tagged as org import in DoiT console, normally, cost explorer data isnt gone. - within customer management account current CUR is in line with DoiT console  (February and March, customer was consolidated end of february) ; - bucket name is `doitintl-awsops-730`  . Inside that bucket,  the CSV Gzipped files are contained within the key `/CUR/doitintl-awsops-730/` - if customer wants to backfill with historical data prior to DoiT onboarding, the easiest path would be a simple 3 step process, as mentioned here - Currently, Im not seeing any AWS support case related to backfill historical data. Comment by Avi Keinan: Hi **Linda Lehto**  Can you update the customer that we will have the history in our system probably starting next week? I asked AWS to backfill the historical costs. Comment by Linda Lehto: Hi Avi, thanks a lot for your help. Will do! Comment by Avi Keinan: Done."

    "Comment by Danilo Prevides: Hi Guys, I hope you are doing well.  We are trying to implement a connection between two clusters, but we are not sure what would be the best way to do it according to our environment.  I would like to discuss with you a possible solution for it.    **A brief description:**  We currently have a Kubernetes cluster running our production applications,we call it as old cluster.  We are creating a new cluster with a new infrastructure to deploy the new version of the application. Both new and old clusters are working great, we just want to access services from both infrastructures in both clusters.  Our new cluster uses a Shared VPC and the old cluster is using its own VPC. I dont feel very comfortable to change the old clusters VPC.    **More details about our infra:**    **For the new cluster we have four google projects:**  host-alpinresorts-79q2 -> A google project which basically contains the Shared VPC definitions.  beta-alpinresorts-ex4z -> A google project for testing beta versions of the new application under development, containg a kubernetes cluster running on the shared vpc created on the hosts project.  prod-alpinresorts-isfn  -> A google project for running our new application under development, with a kubernetes cluster running on the shared vpc created on the hosts project.  admin-alpinresorts-at9e -> A google project for running some tools which can access both prod and beta clusters, like CI pipelines and so on.    **For the old cluster, we have:**  alpinresorts-prod -> A google project with a kubernetes cluster to run our main current application.  alpinresorts-beta -> A google project with a kubernetes cluster to run our main beta test environment..    We basically need to allow access between:  alpinresorts-beta (old cluster) <-> beta-alpinresorts-ex4z (new cluster)  alpinresorts-prod (old cluster) <-> prod-alpinresorts-isfn (new cluster)    Were want to access it internally, not through internet, because:  - We need to access some endpoints which cannot be exported to internet - Our connection between them needs to be as fast as possible    Can you help us? We can have a call to discuss it if you want.    Thanks, Comment by DoiT Helper: Dear CRE, the customer has indicated their preference for a video chat with us.

Comment by Lukas Stiebellehner: Hello Danilo,  Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Lukas, and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that you would like to expose services between GKE clusters in different VPCs/projects, without traffic traversing the internet.  Do your VPCs (new, shared VPC and \"old\" cluster VPCs) use overlapping CIDR blocks or are they distinct? If they don't overlap you could use VPC pairing between your \"old\" VPCs and the new, shared VPC [1] in order to allow cross-VPC networking. You could then use internal load balancers with GKE Ingresses in order to expose specific services to clients in the other cluster(s) [2] - traffic would then be sent over the VPC peering connection and private IP space.  [1] https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering#interaction-subnet-subnet [2] https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress-ilb  I have limited availability for calls this week, but if you would still like to discuss this approach (or alternatives) please feel free to pick a slot in my calendar here:  https://calendly.com/lukas-doit/30min?back=1&month=2023-10   Sincerely,  Lukas (DoiT International) // (CEST) Comment by Lukas Stiebellehner: Hi Danilo,  Unfortunately, I have had a conflicting event coming up today and need to move our call.

    "Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi,    We are facing 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable for our app.declaflow.io website which is hosted on AWS. To resolve the issue of CoPilot domain alias, we tried to create a new environment. However, I am not very sure if this has caused this issue or not. But the primary goal is to make the service up and running as our client work is hampered due to the same.    In breif, in order to link the domain with environment, a staging-new(deleted now) environment was created with a acm certificate on AWS. However, this was only to create a new environment for the pipeline and solve the issue:  \"_To use `http.alias`, your application must be:_  _* Associated with a domain:_  _ `copilot app init --domain example.com`_  _* Or, using imported certificates to your environment:_  _ `copilot env init --import-cert-arns arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`_  _ execute svc deploy: deploy service organisation-api to environment staging: cannot specify http.alias when application is not associated with a domain and env staging doesn't import one or more certificates_\"    But somehow I think(not sure), it has affected the live environment and the service is down.

Comment by Matthew Richardson: Further details received from customer on call:  The Copilot new environment was created by importing the acm ceritificate. The environment name was \"staging-new\". Somehow (not sure) it has disrupted the existing functionality. The service is not running on (https://org.declaflow.io)  The CodePipeline showed the error of domain alias and in order to resolve the same the new environment was created under the same application.  Service App link - https://app.declaflow.io/  Also attached screenshot of main CORS Policy error received from CodePipeline run on application, from going through code changes from customer-side screenshare it looks like they switched application to a new staging environment which may have led to this issue? Comment by Karim Amarsi: **Matthew Richardson** Even though this AWS article says CloudFront the principle behind checking the CORS error will still apply with their scenario: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/no-access-control-allow-origin-error/  As it's an urgent case then perhaps worth suggesting to the customer that they expedite this problem by raising a support case with AWS. Their 640158084476 is on payer #7  but I'm unable to see what AWS support plan level they perhaps worth checking with them. Comment by Matthew Richardson: Thanks for the tip with this **Karim Amarsi**!!  I'll pass the article for checking the CORS error to the customer here and ask them about raising a support case with AWS to expedite this for them. Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Are you free to rejoin the call now with me and one of my colleagues?   Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Gayathri Chavva: I am available to join call as well if we are troubleshooting the issue with the customer . Please let me know Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for your time just on the call with myself and Karim on this issue.  As mentioned, through our Logging access and the screenshare we just had on the call, it was unclear to us what specific change could have caused this issue from the change to the service from using the `staging-new` as opposed to the `staging` environment.  As this is as urgent issue for yourselves and your customers, we would therefore strongly suggest raising this as an Urgent request with AWS in the first instance to resolve this issue most rapidly.  I have attached the link that Karim shared below in [1] on the Premium AWS Support plans available to yourselves for this, I would recommend speaking with your team and setting up a Business level Support plan in order to expedite the resolution for this issue.  I have also attached the general troubleshooting guide we went through for this issue with yourselves in link [2] for your reference.  Please let me know on this ticket if you have any issues with setting up the Business Level AWS Premium Support plan or with raising the case with them on this. Also let me know if there is any further questions for us or if you have any further details from your side that will help us with resolving this for you from our side.  [1] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/ [2] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/no-access-control-allow-origin-error/  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi **Gayathri Chavva** - myself and Karim just finished a call with the customer on this, we went through the CloudWatch logs with him just on the changes made to his service - as far as we can tell it appears the customer made a change to switch resources related to their service from a `staging` environment to a new `staging-new` environment and this is linked to the issues with this production service in their opinion.  On the screenshare we couldn't spot any issues which would have inherently led to the changes, as the broken application was running through their Production environment, so unless there was a linked resource somewhere in the deleted `staging` environment that was running the service (which we couldn't see evidence of from our side), it's hard to determine exactly what caused this from what we could see.  We recommended they raise this with AWS in this case directly for now, so I'll see where that goes, but let me know if you'd like a call on this later today and I can see about maybe having another call with the customer if you think there's any other causes that could have led to this.  **FYI for ticket purposes** - on the recent call, the customer mentioned that their staging & prod environments shared various services across the same account (as in the case of this particular service), on the call we have advised him that it would be beneficial to separate prod, staging, etc. in different accounts as per AWS recommendations Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    I have found one source of the error, when I checked the load balancer in AWS it displayed the issue we are facing. Attached is the screenshot of the same. Can we please connect again on a call and discuss the same.     ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/nLE6Z4J38IdljA7GFQrcxkcE7/?name=kbcjhmpy.png)       Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Sure we can re-connect on a call and discuss this now, please join at the below link:  https://meet.google.com/soz-gkgj-hbc  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin).

See you in tomorrow's meeting.  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for joining todays call with Gayathri. As discussed in the call can we please proceed quickly with the AWS business plan we discussed in the call. It will be great if you can do the next steps for the same as per the discussion in today's meeting.    As this is an urgency, a quick action is appreciated.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi guys,  Thanks also for your time on the call earlier.  We have just taken a look at your account with us from our side and it appears that you are currently set up as a Payer 7 type account, as per the attached screenshot.  This means that setting up the AWS Business Support Plan is something that will need to be done from your side, as you will have all the root account details needed for this to be set up.  For your info, I have attached a guide below in link [1] which explains how you can set up the AWS Business Plan support. Do let us know if you require any information or support from us when setting this up from your side, we will not be able to view any critical billing info from our side, but we can offer you guidance for setting this up if the documentation is unclear in any way.  Also, as I mentioned, you do have the option to cancel this level of support after a period of 1 month, instructions on how to cancel it are attached below in link [2] and I have attached the FAQs section for this in [3].  However as in this case a Prod account and workloads are involved, we would recommend that you keep the Business Support with AWS enabled for your Production accounts as a best practice to effectively deal with future issues. This is completely up to yourselves though and we will continue to offer our best-in-class support from ourselves at DoiT regardless of this.  Let me know if anything is unclear on the above and if not, let me know when this is set up and we will then raise an Urgent Request with AWS to get this issue resolved asap. We will also join on the call with AWS that is scheduled, in order to put our collective minds together on this problem.

Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you and the team are doing well.  I just wanted to check on this ticket, did the information I sent to you guys on Friday make sense & were you and the team able to set up the AWS Business Support Plan from your side?  If so and you need assistance with raising the Urgent ticket with AWS for fixing this issue, let me know and I can arrange to jump on a call with yourselves to help with this from our side at your earliest convenience. We will also be able to attend the appointment with AWS once this is set up, in order to add our support for the resolution with the AWS team and yourselves.  If you have not managed to set up the Business Support Plan from your side yet, let us know the difficulties that are being faced and we can offer any support needed to get over this issue as well, we are just not allowed to review/view any billing information from our side due to the details shared in my last message.  Let me know if we can assist further at this point.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for your concern, we have updated the plan and have raised the ticket for the issue. Yesterday, we had a call with AWS team and today I hope they will get the detailed information on the missing resources.    Today I have another call with the AWS support team. If they are still not able to understand something or need clarification, then we can jump on a call together.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for letting me know about the current status on this and the AWS ticket raised for this issue.  Do let me know if you do require our support on the call with the AWS Support team later today, if so, I will jump on the call with you on this with others from our side at DoiT also to help troubleshoot this with you and the AWS team on the call.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Can we quickly jump on a call? I need an urgent support please.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Yes we can jump on a call now, please use the following link:  https://meet.google.com/omi-cbuf-ryh?pli=1&authuser=0  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for your time on the call just now, I was glad to hear that your main issues are resolved for now, with the exception of the Co-Pilot Staging environment as discussed.  As you mentioned that you are having a call on Monday with the original AWS Engineer on this to resolve that part, I shall leave this ticket open until Wednesday as we discussed, but if you do need me & our team to jump on a further call to resolve anything for you until then, do let me know and I will arrange for another call between us.  Thanks again for your time,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you're doing well and are enjoying your week so far?  I just wanted to see how the call went with the AWS engineer on Monday and to check if the issues relating to your service are now resolved?  If so, I will go ahead and close this ticket, however if you need any more support on this from ourselves at DoiT, I can arrange for us to jump on a call again and we can help you resolve any further issues experienced with your service.  Thanks again,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you are doing well?  We haven't heard from you in a while on this issue, so I hope this is now resolved completely? This ticket will close automatically soon, so I just wanted to make sure everything was ok before the ticket closes.  If this is not resolved, do let us know and we can jump on a call and look to assist you further.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for your support, the live is environment is up and running. Thank you for your support and help, the actual issue of code pipeline remains the same. The code pipeline has still the same issue with copilot and the build cannot be made due to the same. I will keep you updated on the same.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for letting me know about this, should I leave this ticket open for now in that case?  As mentioned, let me know if we can help with resolving that part of this issue with AWS on a call or another method.  If the ticket is kept open for now, I am on annual leave from Thursday onwards so will need to hand the ticket over to another colleague if there are any further actions for us at DoiT in my absence. Let me know which course of action is easiest for you and I'll act accordingly.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin).

Chat ID: v2bgnrbccTzLaheYGqY2.   **scott.foster:**  Time created: 2024-07-02 4:34 PM  how does doit spot scaling differ from AWS  * * *  **Ava:**  Time created: 2024-07-02 4:34 PM  ### DoiT Spot Scaling vs. AWS Spot Instances  #### DoiT Spot Scaling  - **Integration**: DoiT Spot Scaling integrates directly with your AWS account, allowing you to manage and optimize your spot instance usage through the DoiT console. - **Recommendations**: Once linked, DoiT Spot Scaling provides recommendations on the Spot Scaling screen in the DoiT console. These recommendations help you optimize your spot instance usage, ensuring cost efficiency and reliability. - **Ease of Use**: The DoiT console simplifies the process of managing spot instances by providing a user-friendly interface and actionable insights.  For more details, you can check the DoiT Spot Scaling setup guide.  #### AWS Spot Instances  - **Definition**: AWS Spot Instances are spare EC2 capacity that can save you up to 90% off On-Demand prices. However, AWS can interrupt these instances with a two-minute notification. - **Use Cases**: Spot Instances are best suited for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads. They use the same underlying EC2 instances as On-Demand and Reserved Instances. - **Integration with Auto Scaling**: AWS Spot Instances can be integrated with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. This allows you to launch and manage Spot Instances, maintain application availability, diversify instance types, and scale your EC2 capacity using dynamic, scheduled, and predictive scaling policies.  For more information, you can refer to the AWS EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.  ### Key Differences  - **Management Interface**: DoiT provides a specialized console for managing spot instances, whereas AWS uses the standard EC2 and Auto Scaling interfaces. - **Recommendations**: DoiT offers tailored recommendations to optimize spot instance usage, which can simplify decision-making and improve cost efficiency. - **Integration**: While both services integrate with AWS, DoiT adds an additional layer of insights and management capabilities through its console.  By leveraging DoiT Spot Scaling, you can gain more control and insights into your spot instance usage, potentially leading to better cost savings and resource optimization.  * * *"

In your case, I deactivated billing profile 101503 and moved all services (Workapce and AWS) under billing profile 102187.  We can't open two billing profiles for the same customers since it can cause issues with VAT submission.  With regards to your question, \"how [to] determine the payment distribution between Google Workspace and AWS in future invoices\" - you can execute two separate payments; One for Google Workspace and the other for GCP. You can also tag (name) the assets and the name will appear next to the project / subscription name in the line item section.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

I understand that you are self-hosting MySQL on a Compute Engine VM and would like recommendations on how to collect metrics and set up alerting.  I'll strive to get back to you later today.  Sincerely,  Kris Ilowiecki (kris@doit.com) // DoiT International (Zurich) Comment by Kris Ilowiecki: Hi Jordi,  Thank you for your patience. I would recommend using one of the following systems:   **A) Google Cloud's operations suite [1]**  **Process-health filters [2]** Out of the box, you can count MySQL processes by matching their names (or invocations). You can use that within metric-threshold alerting policies [3] to receive notifications when the number of matched processes drops, e.g. to zero. An example of combining these is provided in [4] - you would need to adjust the process name, _thresholdValue_, and the VM instance selector as desired.  **Ops Agent [5]** If you need detailed information about the processes, you may install Google's Ops Agent on the VM instance. It includes MySQL integration [6], providing such in-depth metrics as e.g. the number of locks. You can similarly integrate it with Alerting [7].   **B) Prometheus [8]**  If you prefer to self-host your monitoring and alerting systems, I would recommend using Prometheus. It comes with Alertmanager [9] included. There is an official exporter for MySQL available [10]. If you would like to set up nice dashboards, Prometheus integrates well with Grafana [11]. Do note that setting these up involves significantly more work than just using Google Cloud's tooling from section A).  Let me know if this answers your question, and if not, I will be happy to assist further.

Lets begin with something you may not have heard of, called Blended rates. Blended rates are the averaged rates of the Reserved Instances and On-Demand Instances that are used by member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. AWS calculates blended costs by multiplying the blended rate for each service with an accounts usage of that service. These rates are NOT the rates you would pay, but the rates that Amazon shows in services like Cost Explorer.  For billing purposes, AWS treats all accounts in an AWS organization as if they're one account. The pricing tiers and capacity reservations of the accounts in the organization are combined into one consolidated bill. Combining the accounts into one bill can lower the effective price per hour for some services.  This effective price per hour is displayed as the \"blended\" rate in your Cost and Usage Report or AWS Cost Explorer. The blended rate shown in the console is for informational purposes only.  CMP (DoiTs Cloud Management Platform) does not use the Blended costs, but the actual prices that we will invoice you. CMP is the source of the truth for all billing events. AWS Cost Explorer will continue to suffice in terms of broad strokes but the per item billing will not match your final bill, due to Blended rates. These are main areas where the prices you see in Cost Explorer and your bill are different.  1. Data transfer 2. S3 3. EC2 (Flexsave 0 cost) 4. CloudFront **Data transfer**  **![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YAYtsGy2lwwXhyH0vnizOeCevTijC9hNz2NH8mhRJXLiWsWPWkk-N1cg4wMgDbp6jwCArSOhtZInZWtnh7Df7suHgu6ZoAJ2AqmmeDZSwbE12beDGMpyb92uVPrVV3gRbmrKy4LaBqALS9NrqYFFL08)**  **S3**  **![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/29NpFGP8hXUzTXh4FP1sWkT3UvEFPL8sYAekeOEKA6nPRg4JsE2A2DGpw0jCtuPxOMWJpz53cHoPvzzJCN3NSpmbPUKsO2FQotN-XPwOP1Sbfyr94KtjkHHLYOsKTGsM8Pk65W-CDXCHSc2GAIrO0bs)** **EC2 cost is higher in DoiT invoice than in Cost Explorer (Flexsave shows 0 cost)**  **![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gQiJmfhU6HCYLVev3ZwhUiOqk3UXvGPlyWWmnMy44BWCzR6JY4X8HN06t8tHIbOcvZ_BKadmuS60lZjg8OwiwrEdEzLHE5ofkUZtkJjfhH2XJ8sezEoU0jynNiwAzj1HrM-9_b4J7ZaSIT2pqZXnJSY)**   **We recommend you use CMP (DoiTs Cloud Management Platform) to see the actual billing.**  **Let me know if this clarifies. We can also set up a call to clarify this in detail if that helps.** Comment by Craig Denton: Hi Daniela,    Would it be OK to have a short call, my finance team have some specific questions that I think would be better asked directly.    Regards,  Craig Comment by Daniela Kortin: Hi Craig,  Sure, we can arrange that, hope I can answer all their questions. Please give me 3-4 option for a meeting and time zone.  thanks Comment by Max Williams: Hi Daniela,    Would you be able to do any time from 12:30 today BST for a call with myself?    Kind regards,  Max Comment by Daniela Kortin: Hi Max,  Sent an invite for 13.00  thanks Comment by Max Williams: Hi Daniela,    Thanks for the call now.    Regarding another call with Craig and Nick on as well, would any time tomorrow between 1100 and 1300 or Friday between 1000 and 1400 (all BST) work?

Comment by Daniela Kortin: Hi Max,  Was great talking to you. I found the expiration date for your prepayment, it was just a matter of adding a column to the view - see attached  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/aws_rds_instance_reservations?is_down=false&sort=expirtation_date  Also I had a quick look at the invoices and now understand why you had a drop in January. You were issued agour 14K credits from AWS. Ill look into them later. I am available tomorrow, not on Friday. Waiting for Nick to confirm  Thanks Comment by Craig Denton: The January credits were issued on the back of a Marketplace purchase in December. Comment by Daniela Kortin: Hi Craig, do you mind if I close the ticket and will continue our communication via emails and meeting?  thanks"

    "Comment by Andrew Dundee: User \"andrew.dundee@mirada-medical.com\" created a new chat called \"If I have a resource of typ...\": at 2024-06-25 3:24 PM. Chat ID: TtTQYGM35v1kBZ6gMf0C.   **andrew.dundee:**  Time created: 2024-06-25 3:24 PM  If I have a resource of type AWS::ApiGateway::Account in my cloudformation template and I deploy multiple stacks from that template on the same account and region, is that likely to be problematic?  * * *  **Ava:**  Time created: 2024-06-25 3:24 PM  Yes, deploying multiple stacks from a CloudFormation template that includes a resource of type `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` in the same AWS account and region can be problematic. The `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource is a singleton resource, meaning there can only be one such resource per AWS account per region. This resource represents the API Gateway account settings for the entire AWS account in that region.  When you try to deploy multiple stacks that each include an `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource, CloudFormation will encounter a conflict because it cannot create multiple instances of this singleton resource. This will likely result in deployment failures for the subsequent stacks after the first one.  ### Potential Issues:  1. **Deployment Conflicts**: Only one stack can successfully create the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource. Subsequent attempts to create this resource in other stacks will fail. 2. **Stack Updates**: If you need to update the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` settings, you will have to ensure that the updates are made in the stack that originally created the resource. Updates in other stacks will not be possible. 3. **Resource Management**: Managing a singleton resource across multiple stacks can lead to confusion and potential misconfigurations.  ### Recommendations:  - **Single Stack Management**: Ensure that the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource is defined in a single, dedicated stack. This stack can be referenced by other stacks if needed. - **Cross-Stack References**: Use cross-stack references or export/import values to share the necessary information between stacks without duplicating the singleton resource. - **Modular Templates**: Design your CloudFormation templates in a modular way, separating singleton resources into their own templates and stacks.  ### Example:  You can create a dedicated stack for the `AWS::ApiGateway::Account` resource and export any necessary outputs. Other stacks can then import these outputs as needed.  #### Singleton Stack Template:      Resources:       ApiGatewayAccount:         Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Account         Properties:           CloudWatchRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ApiGatewayCloudWatchRole  #### Other Stack Template:      Resources:       MyApi:         Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi         Properties:           Name: MyApi           # Reference the CloudWatchRoleArn from the singleton stack if needed  By following this approach, you can avoid conflicts and ensure smooth deployments across multiple stacks.  * * *"

    "Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: Hi    We have created a private DNS with a zone called vocls-dev.vastdata.com.    The VPC is peered with out internal networks and addresses are reachable (ex: we can ssh an host or access a service on GKE with TCP load balancer).    But when it comes to private DNS the service either to return empty answer or return the answer to go to vastdata.com even when addressed directly.    The DNS private zone + the dns policy were created with terraform using this HCL configurations      resource \"google_dns_managed_zone\" \"license-server_private_dns_zone\" {      provider = google-beta      project = var.project_id      name = var.private_dns_zone_name      dns_name = var.dns_zone      description = \"Private DNS zone\"      visibility = \"private\"      private_visibility_config {      networks {      network_url = \"projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/${var.vpc_name}\"      }      }     }      resource \"google_dns_policy\" \"allow-private-dns-ingress-policy\" {      name = \"allow-dns-ingress\"      enable_inbound_forwarding = true      enable_logging = true       networks {      network_url = \"projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/${var.vpc_name}\"      }     }    This has worked and the ip assigned is 10.83.0.9 (the network is 10.83.0.0/16).    but when I try to resolve addresses directly when connected to our VPNs or from our offices I get the following answer.      host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. 10.83.0.9     Using domain server:     Name: 10.83.0.9     Address: 10.83.0.9#53     Aliases:      Host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)  However connecting to a VM running in this subnet will resolve the address      host bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com. 10.83.0.9     Using domain server:     Name: 10.83.0.9     Address: 10.83.0.9#53     Aliases:      bla.vocls-dev.vastdata.com has address 1.1.1.1    The firewall allows all UDP traffic when connected from VPN/Offices, also if it was a FW issue response would have simply timed out.    I have talked to out IT and they verified we are not doing any kind of packets manipulations when it comes to DNS.  It is also important to mention that we have used this configuration several times at different projects with different subsets before and it always worked.

Can you try to do a simple check, I would like to make sure that this IP address \"10.83.0.9\" is reachable from your on-prem servers, just do this command from an on-prem and/or with your VPN (please specify cases (with or without VPN) when you share results):       $ping 10.83.0.9   Please share the command output, thanks,  Best Regards,      Jean-Alain Mignon (ja.mignon@doit.com) // DoiT International (Paris) Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: this will not work as I dont think that the DNS service will answer ping as I think it does not answer to ICMP packets.  I also tried it with a working DNS service in other project and it will answer ping    So I dont think it is a valid test Comment by Tal Engel-Potlog: I have tried to remove & recreate the policy and got the same result ... not the ip is 10.83.0.11 Comment by Jean-Alain Mignon: Hello Tal,  The idea behind the ping is just to confirm that you can reach this particular IP from on-prem, because this can be a reason, the DNS Service from on-prem has to reach the DNS resolver in GCP by using his IP, DNS uses IP layer over udp as you know, also now if you have change the DNS Resolver to 10.83.0.11 just make sure that you can ping this address from on on prem, this is just a basic connectivity test, if you wish I can setup a Google Video Call, please let me know,  Also to able to request a GCP private DNS host zone you need a private connectivity between on-prem and GCP, which private connectivity do you have from on-prem at the moment?

    "Comment by Jason He: Hi DoiT team - We got our invoice for April 2022 yesterday and something seemed a bit off. As apart of the new deal we signed a few months ago, we were issued a bucket of credits that seemingly we ran through in March. This specifically was the google portion of the credits per the following screenshots:     ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/TqFZ78nCFUFBVgEzdVwvnH9aW/?name=kedlybxj.png)    ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/p0lpTImFT0M2uHZ3HsOGCtt21/?name=evnlgfux.png) (Specifically, the migration credit dated March of 2022 on that 2nd screenshot).    However per the invoice we got, we seem to have been charged the **full price** and not the reduced one with the credits applied like we see in google's billing view.

Comment by Maggie Ambrose: Hi Andrea is there any more information on this from product? Comment by Sven Gerhard: **Andrea De La Vega** Please follow up and provide an update to the customer. Comment by Andrea De La Vega: **Sven Gerhard** this is an internal ticket and communication is only happening between Maggie and I.  **Maggie Ambrose** I reached out to the product team again, hopefully ill have information soon.  https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/C023EL4637U/p1695063648482719 (private channel) Comment by Sven Gerhard: OH, I see that @Maggie Ambrose requested that ticket for kyle.bank@phenixrts.com, and just looked at that you had responded to it to the customer. So maybe that was a mistake. Comment by Andrea De La Vega: Hi **Maggie Ambrose** This is the information I received from the Product Manager:   > When flexsave was active, the savings were recognized in Flexsave savings. > > > > When we spun down Flexsave, there were several hours where the customer was getting the full 3-year savings recognized as their own CUDs (even though they were Flexsave CUDs)   Please let me know if this does not make sense and I will go back to him.  Thank you! Comment by Sven Gerhard: Hey Kyle, Please note that the ticket is now closed. If there are any additional requirements, please reopen the ticket or create a new one using /GetPSS and we will manage that request for you.

    "Comment by Gregor Pacnik: Hi    We are looking for some guidance/help on how to best setup limited access to one of GCS buckets from our back-office React app.    In the app there are currently only 5 users. Authentication is via firebase auth + custom claims. The idea is to be able to display images stored in GCS bucket to only people that are logged into the app and no one else (public). All users would have access to all the images so there is no need for user level permissions.    I guess we are looking for the neatest solution on how to issue individual GCS access keys per login session.

My name is Paul and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that your using Firebase and GCS and would like to limit access to your GCS storage to only authenticated users.  Given you are using Firebase you could add the Bucket to Firebase storage  and then use the firebase SDK to download files as follows [1]?  Also use firebase storage security rules to allow only authenticated users to download (instead of the Google allAuthenticatedUsers setting)  This firebase storage security rule would allow all authenticated users to read from a path in the bucket      service firebase.storage { match /b/{bucket}/o { match /{allPaths=**} { allow read: if request.auth != null; } }}   Does that sound like an acceptable solution for your use case?

Follow up question, how can I give firebase account permission to access the bucket? For reference, the firebase app is in the `nl-urkel` project whereas the target bucket `nl-urkel-storage` I want to grant the access to is in `neighbourlytics-dev-170803` project and cannot be moved due to being used by many services and accounts in there.    I've granted this ticket read-only access to the nl-urkel project if that helps.    Thanks.

Don't stress, this is not on our critical path yet.    If Firebase is giving you grief we are happy to explore direct connection to GCS. We are using Firebase function to issue enriched claims JWT so it should be fairly easy to add extra code to provide access token for GCS. This would then in turn help us with doing a similar approach but from our .net core backend for another app with similar access requirements.

Comment by Paul O'Brien: Hi Gregor,  You could either you the process you outlined or the Firebase method which is to use Custom Claims to support issuing commands against another project.  Since you have the enriched JWT process setup I think you could do either approach, from a personal preference I think the one outlined below is more scalable and agile.

Comment by Sean Matthews: Hi Team,  Please refer to the internal note below with the background to this query.  Thank you kindly, Sean Matthews Comment by Mehdi Nemlaghi: Quickly looked at customer management account:   - customer is tagged as org import in DoiT console, normally, cost explorer data isnt gone. - within customer management account current CUR is in line with DoiT console  (February and March, customer was consolidated end of february) ; - bucket name is `doitintl-awsops-730`  . Inside that bucket,  the CSV Gzipped files are contained within the key `/CUR/doitintl-awsops-730/` - if customer wants to backfill with historical data prior to DoiT onboarding, the easiest path would be a simple 3 step process, as mentioned here - Currently, Im not seeing any AWS support case related to backfill historical data. Comment by Avi Keinan: Hi **Linda Lehto**  Can you update the customer that we will have the history in our system probably starting next week? I asked AWS to backfill the historical costs. Comment by Linda Lehto: Hi Avi, thanks a lot for your help. Will do! Comment by Avi Keinan: Done."

    "Comment by Danilo Prevides: Hi Guys, I hope you are doing well.  We are trying to implement a connection between two clusters, but we are not sure what would be the best way to do it according to our environment.  I would like to discuss with you a possible solution for it.    **A brief description:**  We currently have a Kubernetes cluster running our production applications,we call it as old cluster.  We are creating a new cluster with a new infrastructure to deploy the new version of the application. Both new and old clusters are working great, we just want to access services from both infrastructures in both clusters.  Our new cluster uses a Shared VPC and the old cluster is using its own VPC. I dont feel very comfortable to change the old clusters VPC.    **More details about our infra:**    **For the new cluster we have four google projects:**  host-alpinresorts-79q2 -> A google project which basically contains the Shared VPC definitions.  beta-alpinresorts-ex4z -> A google project for testing beta versions of the new application under development, containg a kubernetes cluster running on the shared vpc created on the hosts project.  prod-alpinresorts-isfn  -> A google project for running our new application under development, with a kubernetes cluster running on the shared vpc created on the hosts project.  admin-alpinresorts-at9e -> A google project for running some tools which can access both prod and beta clusters, like CI pipelines and so on.    **For the old cluster, we have:**  alpinresorts-prod -> A google project with a kubernetes cluster to run our main current application.  alpinresorts-beta -> A google project with a kubernetes cluster to run our main beta test environment..    We basically need to allow access between:  alpinresorts-beta (old cluster) <-> beta-alpinresorts-ex4z (new cluster)  alpinresorts-prod (old cluster) <-> prod-alpinresorts-isfn (new cluster)    Were want to access it internally, not through internet, because:  - We need to access some endpoints which cannot be exported to internet - Our connection between them needs to be as fast as possible    Can you help us? We can have a call to discuss it if you want.    Thanks, Comment by DoiT Helper: Dear CRE, the customer has indicated their preference for a video chat with us.

Comment by Lukas Stiebellehner: Hello Danilo,  Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Lukas, and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that you would like to expose services between GKE clusters in different VPCs/projects, without traffic traversing the internet.  Do your VPCs (new, shared VPC and \"old\" cluster VPCs) use overlapping CIDR blocks or are they distinct? If they don't overlap you could use VPC pairing between your \"old\" VPCs and the new, shared VPC [1] in order to allow cross-VPC networking. You could then use internal load balancers with GKE Ingresses in order to expose specific services to clients in the other cluster(s) [2] - traffic would then be sent over the VPC peering connection and private IP space.  [1] https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering#interaction-subnet-subnet [2] https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress-ilb  I have limited availability for calls this week, but if you would still like to discuss this approach (or alternatives) please feel free to pick a slot in my calendar here:  https://calendly.com/lukas-doit/30min?back=1&month=2023-10   Sincerely,  Lukas (DoiT International) // (CEST) Comment by Lukas Stiebellehner: Hi Danilo,  Unfortunately, I have had a conflicting event coming up today and need to move our call.

    "Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi,    We are facing 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable for our app.declaflow.io website which is hosted on AWS. To resolve the issue of CoPilot domain alias, we tried to create a new environment. However, I am not very sure if this has caused this issue or not. But the primary goal is to make the service up and running as our client work is hampered due to the same.    In breif, in order to link the domain with environment, a staging-new(deleted now) environment was created with a acm certificate on AWS. However, this was only to create a new environment for the pipeline and solve the issue:  \"_To use `http.alias`, your application must be:_  _* Associated with a domain:_  _ `copilot app init --domain example.com`_  _* Or, using imported certificates to your environment:_  _ `copilot env init --import-cert-arns arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`_  _ execute svc deploy: deploy service organisation-api to environment staging: cannot specify http.alias when application is not associated with a domain and env staging doesn't import one or more certificates_\"    But somehow I think(not sure), it has affected the live environment and the service is down.

In the meantime, we will take a look at this for you now and look to resolve this issue for yourselves asap.  Sincerely,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin).

Comment by Matthew Richardson: Further details received from customer on call:  The Copilot new environment was created by importing the acm ceritificate. The environment name was \"staging-new\". Somehow (not sure) it has disrupted the existing functionality. The service is not running on (https://org.declaflow.io)  The CodePipeline showed the error of domain alias and in order to resolve the same the new environment was created under the same application.  Service App link - https://app.declaflow.io/  Also attached screenshot of main CORS Policy error received from CodePipeline run on application, from going through code changes from customer-side screenshare it looks like they switched application to a new staging environment which may have led to this issue? Comment by Karim Amarsi: **Matthew Richardson** Even though this AWS article says CloudFront the principle behind checking the CORS error will still apply with their scenario: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/no-access-control-allow-origin-error/  As it's an urgent case then perhaps worth suggesting to the customer that they expedite this problem by raising a support case with AWS. Their 640158084476 is on payer #7  but I'm unable to see what AWS support plan level they perhaps worth checking with them. Comment by Matthew Richardson: Thanks for the tip with this **Karim Amarsi**!!  I'll pass the article for checking the CORS error to the customer here and ask them about raising a support case with AWS to expedite this for them. Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Are you free to rejoin the call now with me and one of my colleagues?   Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Gayathri Chavva: I am available to join call as well if we are troubleshooting the issue with the customer . Please let me know Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for your time just on the call with myself and Karim on this issue.  As mentioned, through our Logging access and the screenshare we just had on the call, it was unclear to us what specific change could have caused this issue from the change to the service from using the `staging-new` as opposed to the `staging` environment.  As this is as urgent issue for yourselves and your customers, we would therefore strongly suggest raising this as an Urgent request with AWS in the first instance to resolve this issue most rapidly.  I have attached the link that Karim shared below in [1] on the Premium AWS Support plans available to yourselves for this, I would recommend speaking with your team and setting up a Business level Support plan in order to expedite the resolution for this issue.  I have also attached the general troubleshooting guide we went through for this issue with yourselves in link [2] for your reference.  Please let me know on this ticket if you have any issues with setting up the Business Level AWS Premium Support plan or with raising the case with them on this. Also let me know if there is any further questions for us or if you have any further details from your side that will help us with resolving this for you from our side.  [1] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/ [2] https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/no-access-control-allow-origin-error/  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi **Gayathri Chavva** - myself and Karim just finished a call with the customer on this, we went through the CloudWatch logs with him just on the changes made to his service - as far as we can tell it appears the customer made a change to switch resources related to their service from a `staging` environment to a new `staging-new` environment and this is linked to the issues with this production service in their opinion.  On the screenshare we couldn't spot any issues which would have inherently led to the changes, as the broken application was running through their Production environment, so unless there was a linked resource somewhere in the deleted `staging` environment that was running the service (which we couldn't see evidence of from our side), it's hard to determine exactly what caused this from what we could see.  We recommended they raise this with AWS in this case directly for now, so I'll see where that goes, but let me know if you'd like a call on this later today and I can see about maybe having another call with the customer if you think there's any other causes that could have led to this.  **FYI for ticket purposes** - on the recent call, the customer mentioned that their staging & prod environments shared various services across the same account (as in the case of this particular service), on the call we have advised him that it would be beneficial to separate prod, staging, etc. in different accounts as per AWS recommendations Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    I have found one source of the error, when I checked the load balancer in AWS it displayed the issue we are facing. Attached is the screenshot of the same. Can we please connect again on a call and discuss the same.     ![](https://doitintl.zendesk.com/attachments/token/nLE6Z4J38IdljA7GFQrcxkcE7/?name=kbcjhmpy.png)       Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Sure we can re-connect on a call and discuss this now, please join at the below link:  https://meet.google.com/soz-gkgj-hbc  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin).

See you in tomorrow's meeting.  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for joining todays call with Gayathri. As discussed in the call can we please proceed quickly with the AWS business plan we discussed in the call. It will be great if you can do the next steps for the same as per the discussion in today's meeting.    As this is an urgency, a quick action is appreciated.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi guys,  Thanks also for your time on the call earlier.  We have just taken a look at your account with us from our side and it appears that you are currently set up as a Payer 7 type account, as per the attached screenshot.  This means that setting up the AWS Business Support Plan is something that will need to be done from your side, as you will have all the root account details needed for this to be set up.  For your info, I have attached a guide below in link [1] which explains how you can set up the AWS Business Plan support. Do let us know if you require any information or support from us when setting this up from your side, we will not be able to view any critical billing info from our side, but we can offer you guidance for setting this up if the documentation is unclear in any way.  Also, as I mentioned, you do have the option to cancel this level of support after a period of 1 month, instructions on how to cancel it are attached below in link [2] and I have attached the FAQs section for this in [3].  However as in this case a Prod account and workloads are involved, we would recommend that you keep the Business Support with AWS enabled for your Production accounts as a best practice to effectively deal with future issues. This is completely up to yourselves though and we will continue to offer our best-in-class support from ourselves at DoiT regardless of this.  Let me know if anything is unclear on the above and if not, let me know when this is set up and we will then raise an Urgent Request with AWS to get this issue resolved asap. We will also join on the call with AWS that is scheduled, in order to put our collective minds together on this problem.

Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you and the team are doing well.  I just wanted to check on this ticket, did the information I sent to you guys on Friday make sense & were you and the team able to set up the AWS Business Support Plan from your side?  If so and you need assistance with raising the Urgent ticket with AWS for fixing this issue, let me know and I can arrange to jump on a call with yourselves to help with this from our side at your earliest convenience. We will also be able to attend the appointment with AWS once this is set up, in order to add our support for the resolution with the AWS team and yourselves.  If you have not managed to set up the Business Support Plan from your side yet, let us know the difficulties that are being faced and we can offer any support needed to get over this issue as well, we are just not allowed to review/view any billing information from our side due to the details shared in my last message.  Let me know if we can assist further at this point.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for your concern, we have updated the plan and have raised the ticket for the issue. Yesterday, we had a call with AWS team and today I hope they will get the detailed information on the missing resources.    Today I have another call with the AWS support team. If they are still not able to understand something or need clarification, then we can jump on a call together.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for letting me know about the current status on this and the AWS ticket raised for this issue.  Do let me know if you do require our support on the call with the AWS Support team later today, if so, I will jump on the call with you on this with others from our side at DoiT also to help troubleshoot this with you and the AWS team on the call.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Can we quickly jump on a call? I need an urgent support please.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Yes we can jump on a call now, please use the following link:  https://meet.google.com/omi-cbuf-ryh?pli=1&authuser=0  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for your time on the call just now, I was glad to hear that your main issues are resolved for now, with the exception of the Co-Pilot Staging environment as discussed.  As you mentioned that you are having a call on Monday with the original AWS Engineer on this to resolve that part, I shall leave this ticket open until Wednesday as we discussed, but if you do need me & our team to jump on a further call to resolve anything for you until then, do let me know and I will arrange for another call between us.  Thanks again for your time,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you're doing well and are enjoying your week so far?  I just wanted to see how the call went with the AWS engineer on Monday and to check if the issues relating to your service are now resolved?  If so, I will go ahead and close this ticket, however if you need any more support on this from ourselves at DoiT, I can arrange for us to jump on a call again and we can help you resolve any further issues experienced with your service.  Thanks again,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  I hope you are doing well?  We haven't heard from you in a while on this issue, so I hope this is now resolved completely? This ticket will close automatically soon, so I just wanted to make sure everything was ok before the ticket closes.  If this is not resolved, do let us know and we can jump on a call and look to assist you further.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin). Comment by Ritesh Tandon: Hi Matthew,    Thanks for your support, the live is environment is up and running. Thank you for your support and help, the actual issue of code pipeline remains the same. The code pipeline has still the same issue with copilot and the build cannot be made due to the same. I will keep you updated on the same.    Thanks,  Ritesh Comment by Matthew Richardson: Hi Ritesh,  Thanks for letting me know about this, should I leave this ticket open for now in that case?  As mentioned, let me know if we can help with resolving that part of this issue with AWS on a call or another method.  If the ticket is kept open for now, I am on annual leave from Thursday onwards so will need to hand the ticket over to another colleague if there are any further actions for us at DoiT in my absence. Let me know which course of action is easiest for you and I'll act accordingly.  Thanks,  Matthew Richardson (matthew@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International (Dublin).

I picked up this ticket from Matt who is on holidays.  Apologies, that the ticket got auto closed. I am keeping it pending state for now.

Chat ID: v2bgnrbccTzLaheYGqY2.   **scott.foster:**  Time created: 2024-07-02 4:34 PM  how does doit spot scaling differ from AWS  * * *  **Ava:**  Time created: 2024-07-02 4:34 PM  ### DoiT Spot Scaling vs. AWS Spot Instances  #### DoiT Spot Scaling  - **Integration**: DoiT Spot Scaling integrates directly with your AWS account, allowing you to manage and optimize your spot instance usage through the DoiT console. - **Recommendations**: Once linked, DoiT Spot Scaling provides recommendations on the Spot Scaling screen in the DoiT console. These recommendations help you optimize your spot instance usage, ensuring cost efficiency and reliability. - **Ease of Use**: The DoiT console simplifies the process of managing spot instances by providing a user-friendly interface and actionable insights.  For more details, you can check the DoiT Spot Scaling setup guide.  #### AWS Spot Instances  - **Definition**: AWS Spot Instances are spare EC2 capacity that can save you up to 90% off On-Demand prices. However, AWS can interrupt these instances with a two-minute notification. - **Use Cases**: Spot Instances are best suited for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads. They use the same underlying EC2 instances as On-Demand and Reserved Instances. - **Integration with Auto Scaling**: AWS Spot Instances can be integrated with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. This allows you to launch and manage Spot Instances, maintain application availability, diversify instance types, and scale your EC2 capacity using dynamic, scheduled, and predictive scaling policies.  For more information, you can refer to the AWS EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.  ### Key Differences  - **Management Interface**: DoiT provides a specialized console for managing spot instances, whereas AWS uses the standard EC2 and Auto Scaling interfaces. - **Recommendations**: DoiT offers tailored recommendations to optimize spot instance usage, which can simplify decision-making and improve cost efficiency. - **Integration**: While both services integrate with AWS, DoiT adds an additional layer of insights and management capabilities through its console.  By leveraging DoiT Spot Scaling, you can gain more control and insights into your spot instance usage, potentially leading to better cost savings and resource optimization.  * * *"

P.S:  I did not request to delete the Google-Workspace-related profile, ID - 101503 (named: \"Intezer\"), I only requested to change its currency to ILS      Thanks,  Mark Comment by Dina Peisahov: Hi Mark,  When a customer asks to change the currency of a certain billing profile, that billing profile is deactivated and another one (in the requested currency) is opened. In your case, I deactivated billing profile 101503 and moved all services (Workapce and AWS) under billing profile 102187.  We can't open two billing profiles for the same customers since it can cause issues with VAT submission.  With regards to your question, \"how [to] determine the payment distribution between Google Workspace and AWS in future invoices\" - you can execute two separate payments; One for Google Workspace and the other for GCP. You can also tag (name) the assets and the name will appear next to the project / subscription name in the line item section.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

I understand that you are self-hosting MySQL on a Compute Engine VM and would like recommendations on how to collect metrics and set up alerting.  I'll strive to get back to you later today.  Sincerely,  Kris Ilowiecki (kris@doit.com) // DoiT International (Zurich) Comment by Kris Ilowiecki: Hi Jordi,  Thank you for your patience. I would recommend using one of the following systems:   **A) Google Cloud's operations suite [1]**  **Process-health filters [2]** Out of the box, you can count MySQL processes by matching their names (or invocations). You can use that within metric-threshold alerting policies [3] to receive notifications when the number of matched processes drops, e.g. to zero. An example of combining these is provided in [4] - you would need to adjust the process name, _thresholdValue_, and the VM instance selector as desired.  **Ops Agent [5]** If you need detailed information about the processes, you may install Google's Ops Agent on the VM instance. It includes MySQL integration [6], providing such in-depth metrics as e.g. the number of locks. You can similarly integrate it with Alerting [7].   **B) Prometheus [8]**  If you prefer to self-host your monitoring and alerting systems, I would recommend using Prometheus. It comes with Alertmanager [9] included. There is an official exporter for MySQL available [10]. If you would like to set up nice dashboards, Prometheus integrates well with Grafana [11]. Do note that setting these up involves significantly more work than just using Google Cloud's tooling from section A).  Let me know if this answers your question, and if not, I will be happy to assist further.

Its been picked up by my finance team that our services are relatively static and our bill is getting progressively more expensive since the account moves? Comment by Dina Peisahov: Hi **Daniela Kortin** I'm forwarding this ticket to you. Comment by Craig Denton: Hi, do we have any updates on this? Comment by Daniela Kortin: Hi Craig,  First of all let me assure you this is a very common issue with our customers. I'm sorry you were not educated about this earlier.  Lets begin with something you may not have heard of, called Blended rates. Blended rates are the averaged rates of the Reserved Instances and On-Demand Instances that are used by member accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. AWS calculates blended costs by multiplying the blended rate for each service with an accounts usage of that service. These rates are NOT the rates you would pay, but the rates that Amazon shows in services like Cost Explorer.  For billing purposes, AWS treats all accounts in an AWS organization as if they're one account. The pricing tiers and capacity reservations of the accounts in the organization are combined into one consolidated bill. Combining the accounts into one bill can lower the effective price per hour for some services.  This effective price per hour is displayed as the \"blended\" rate in your Cost and Usage Report or AWS Cost Explorer. The blended rate shown in the console is for informational purposes only.  CMP (DoiTs Cloud Management Platform) does not use the Blended costs, but the actual prices that we will invoice you. CMP is the source of the truth for all billing events.

    "Comment by Ashley Painter: Good morning. We have an issue with our Kubernetes cluster in AWS that is preventing us from scheduling more pods. The pods never reach the ready state. Two of our master nodes show as NotReady, with the kubelet not correctly reporting status. The kubelet logs show a failure to connect to the localhost on 443 (I assume this is the connection to the API server).    New instances that are spun up are also unable to register with the cluster.    This is a P1 which is likely to transition to a P0 very quickly if we can't get the issue resolved.    Do you have resource that can assist us?    The Kubernetes cluster is running on ec2 instances, not using managed Kubernetes of any kind.    Many thanks Comment by DoiT Helper: Zenrouter () assigned the ticket to james.sheard@doit-intl.com:   - not on vacation - available in Zenrouter - within working hours - not out of office - no focus time event - not in a meeting and no upcoming meetings - current active tickets weight is below the threshold - low frequency of ticket assignment, last assigned ticket more than 3.0h ago - more than 1 hour left till end of the working day - matching primary category skills [aws/category/containers] Comment by Eyal Zekaria: Is this a new cluster, or an existing cluster that works and suddenly stopped?  Ask them to share:  1. kubelet logs 2. how did they create the cluster (kubeadm, kops, rancher, etc) and the configuration used Comment by James Sheard: Hello Ashley,  Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is James, and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that you are having issues with connecting to localhost 443.  Please can you provide us with the kubelet logs?  How did you create the cluster (was it through the AWS console or using something such as KubeADM, kops, Rancher, etc.)?  How new is the cluster? Is it brand new or has it been working as suddenly stopped?  I am looking forwards to hearing from you.  Sincerely,  James Sheard (james.sheard@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Comment by Ashley Painter: Hi James. We will look to get the log sent over. This is an old cluster that was deployed via Terraform. It's a self managed K8s set up but has not been maintained properly. This was working until the weekend where the instances had no available resources to be able to create the required pods / deployments etc. We are using Spot.io to manage auto scaling for the cluster but new instances are unable to register with the cluster.    One other thing we have noticed is the kube-api certificate appears to have expired in April so we would like to try and renew this. Do you think this would be related?    Thanks Comment by James Sheard: Hello Ashley,  It is likely that the kube-api certificate is the issue.  From a previous ticket, I can see that you have been using Kops.  What version of Kops are you running?  Sincerely,  James Sheard (james.sheard@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Comment by Ashley Painter: 1.15.2 Comment by Ashley Painter: Kubelet log from one of the master nodes attached Comment by Ashley Painter: Happy to have a call on this if you are available. Comment by James Sheard: Hello Ashley,  I am available via the following Google Meet:  https://meet.google.com/cwj-xaek-uau  There is a KOPS guide on rotating secrets [1] for 1.15.2 but I would highly recommend trying this within a development area first.  [1] - https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/1.15.2/docs/rotate-secrets.md  Sincerely,  James Sheard (james.sheard@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Comment by Eyal Zekaria: Hey team,  Just to summarize the call, we found that the issue stemmed from a bug with `etcd-cluster-manager` in the kops version you are running (1.15.2) [1] - it wasn't rotating the certificates used for communication between etcd and the kube-apiserver. Since 2 out of 3 of your CP nodes were created more than a year ago, the certificate on those nodes was expired and essentially meant that the kube-apiserver could not run on them.  Those certificates are generated when a node start up and joins the cluster, so the solution was to recreate all control plane nodes in a rolling fashion.  Throughout the process we tackled another issue, in which the AMI used for those nodes (Debian 9) was missing and heavily outdated. We decided to use an Ubuntu 18.04 AMI [2] instead (even though it's quite old by now, it's still LTS and should be around).  Once we recreated all the control plane nodes, autoscaling started working again and workloads could be scheduled.  As a next step, we recommended that you at least update your cluster using kops 1.15.3 [3] in order to get the certificate rotation working again (with the patched version of `etcd-cluster-manager`).  In the long term you should plan on retiring this cluster altogether since k8s version 1.15 is long outdated and will continue causing problem for you in the future. We recommend considering a managed Kubernetes service (EKS, GKE, etc), or in the worst case, create a fresh cluster running a recent version of k8s to run your workload and keep it up to date.  [1] https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/advisories/etcd-manager-certificate-expiration.md [2] https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/operations/images.md#distros-support-matrix [3] https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/releases/1.15-notes/#1152-to-1153  As discussed, I'll keep the ticket around for a while to give you a chance to make sure everything works as expected and ask any related questions if necessary.  Hope you have a good rest of the week!  Sincerely,  Eyal Zekaria (eyal.z@doit-intl.com) // DoiT International Comment by Ashley Painter: Hi. Many thanks again for your help earlier. The nodes are scaling and pods starting successfully now. Regarding our other requirement of redeploying one of the services, we have managed to redeploy using a helm rollback and specifying the broken release. Please go ahead and close this ticket off now.

If they have restarted it and it isn't working, check for duplicate `PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms` fields etc.  However, I would recommend that they generate a newer and more secure key using an algorithm like **ECDSA** or **ED25519**.       ssh-keygen -t ed25519ssh-keygen -t ecdsa   If they can't access the machine because of this issue they'll need to either:  - Userdata script - Use SSM (if installed) - EC2 instance connect - Mount the root volume to another instance https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/user-data-replace-key-pair-ec2 Comment by Tibor Szalai: Hello Brad,  Thank you for contacting DoiT International. My name is Tibor, and I was assigned to your case.  I understand that you can not connect to your Bastion host due to userauth_pubkey.  Do you have access to your Bastion host via EC2 instance connect [1] or Session Manager[2]?  If you do I would like you to share the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` with us.
