-- Understanding Key Metrics
-- Accuracy: The proportion of predictions that the model got right.
-- Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions. It measures the model's accuracy in classifying a sample as positive.
-- Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It measures the model's ability to detect positive samples.
-- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances both the precision and recall metrics.
-- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): A metric for binary classification models that measures the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate. For multiclass classification, you might see AUC-PR (Precision-Recall Curve) instead.
-- Log Loss: Measures the uncertainty of the probabilities of your model's predictions.

-- Analyzing the performance of your Random Forest model with the metrics provided from ML.EVALUATE gives us several insights and suggests areas for further investigation and adjustment. Here's a detailed analysis based on the metrics:
-- Precision: 0.1060
-- Low precision indicates that the model generates a high number of false positives. For every 100 positive predictions made by the model, only about 11 are correct, while 89 are incorrect.
-- Recall: 0.3333
-- The recall rate shows that the model identifies about 33% of all actual positive cases correctly. This suggests the model is missing out on two-thirds of the positive cases, indicating potential underfitting or insufficient feature representation.
-- Accuracy: 0.3182
-- An accuracy of around 32% is low for most practical applications, indicating the model struggles to correctly classify the sentiments overall.
-- F1 Score: 0.1609
-- The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, remains low. This metric is particularly important in scenarios where an equilibrium between precision and recall is crucial. The low F1 score here reinforces the idea that the model's ability to accurately predict positive cases is limited.
-- Log Loss: 1.1635
-- The log loss provides insight into the confidence of the predictions. A lower log loss is better, and while this score isn't excessively high, there's room for improvement, especially in enhancing the certainty of predictions.
-- ROC AUC: 0.0
-- A ROC AUC of 0.0 is highly concerning. This metric measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes. A score of 0.0 suggests the model performs no better than random guessing. In practical terms, this might indicate an issue with how the model is trained, a severe class imbalance, or that the features used for training do not effectively capture differences between classes.
